A United States (US) agency was reported by the Wall Street Journal to have assessed the pandemic had likely been caused by an unintended Chinese laboratory leak, raising pressure on the WHO to come up with answers. Beijing denies the assessment which could soon become public after the US House of Representatives voted this week to declassify it. "Understanding COVID19's origins and exploring all hypotheses remains: a scientific imperative, to help us prevent future outbreaks (and) a moral imperative, for the sake of the millions of people who died and those who live with #LongCOVID," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Twitter late on Saturday. He was writing to mark three years since the WHO first used the word "pandemic" to describe the global outbreak of COVID-19. Activists, politicians, and academics said in an open letter this weekend that the focus of the anniversary should be on preventing a repeat of the unequal COVID-19 vaccine rollout, saying this led to at least 1.3 million preventable deaths.  --Reuters-- #OnThisDay, I’m reflecting on the 1st weeks of #COVID19.
