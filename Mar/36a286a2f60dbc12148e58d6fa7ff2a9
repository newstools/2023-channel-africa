The number of people affected by Cyclone Freddy has also risen to 383 000 - 226 000 in Madagascar and more than 163 300 in Mozambique, according to the latest United Nations situation report. “Even though the intensity of Cyclone Freddy was not as much as we expected, hundreds of thousands of people are in need of humanitarian assistance. Recovery will take months,” Pasqualina Di Sirio, the World Food Programme's representative in Madagascar told the BBC. Flooding is unlikely in south-eastern Zimbabwe as cyclone Freddy did not extend as far inland as previously forecasted. --BBC--
