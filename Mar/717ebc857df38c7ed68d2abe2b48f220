"The President-Elect will be moving into Defence House, in Maitama, FCT, where he will spend the next couple of months, and from where he will move into the Presidential Villa," it said in a tweet. It did not specify when Tinubu will move to the facility. Tinubu will receive briefings and hold key meetings at the location, a local newspaper reports. Outgoing President Muhammadu Buhari had also moved into the facility ahead of his swearing-in in May 2015, it adds. Tinubu was declared the presidential election winner with 37%. Opposition parties have said they will challenge the result in court. They have 21 days from the day the results were announced to challenge the result at Nigeria's highest appeal court. --BBC--
