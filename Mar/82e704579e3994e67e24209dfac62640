Seventy-one people were injured, 29 of them critically. The accident happenedÂ  this Thursday morning during rush hour, and both vehicles were carrying commuters. The bus was taking civil servants to work while the train was shuttling commuters from the outskirts of Lagos into the city. At the site of the crash, the wreckage has been cleared, but shards of glass and blood can still be seen. Cars have started driving across the tracks once more. The BBC spoke to angry bystanders who complained about the lack of a barrier separating the tracks from the road. They said it was the second accident like this in a year. The injured have been moved to a nearby hospital, and the bodies of those killed are now in a mortuary. The governor of Lagos has declared three days of mourning and a half work day on Friday. Flags will also fly at half-mast. --BBC--
