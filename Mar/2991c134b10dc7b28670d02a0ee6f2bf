In Rand terms the current account deficit for the October-December period was R174.0 billion ($9.374 million) , down from a surplus of R3.1 billion ($167 million) in the previous quarter. The trade surplus fell to R12.2 billion ($657.4 million) in the fourth quarter from R248.8 billion ($13.4 billion)in the third quarter, as the value of the country's imports increased while that of exports decreased. "The increase in the Rand price of imported goods and service was broad-based, however the prices of machinery and electrical equipment, travel services, and transportation services increased the most. The decrease in the rand price of exported goods and services reflected decreases in price of mining exports, especially mineral products and platinum group metals," the central bank explained. Data showed on Tuesday that South Africa's economyÂ contracted by 1.3% in the fourth quarter as rolling power cuts contributed to most sectors, from agriculture to mining, shrinking.  --Reuters--
