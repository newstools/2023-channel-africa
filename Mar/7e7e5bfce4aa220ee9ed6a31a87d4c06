The World Meteorological Organisation is currently analysing the weather system to see if its longevity is indeed record-breaking. Over the past week or so, it has bounced between southern Mozambique and coastal Madagascar. However, it is now strengthening again, and its last act is to head back to Mozambique, as a cyclone once more, with wind gusts in excess of 160kilometre/hour and a coastal storm surge. Into next week, impactful rain will also occur over parts of Zimbabwe and southern Zambia. This, however, could be the last act of this long-lasting storm. --BBC--
