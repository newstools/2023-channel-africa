The Director of a hospital in a disputed city in the Somaliland region says at least 145 people have been killed in more than two months of fighting between anti-government fighters and Somaliland security forces after local elders declared their intention to reunite with Somalia. Abdimajid Sugulle, with the public hospital in Las-Anod, told The Associated Press over the weekend that more than 1 080 other people have been wounded and over 100 000 families have fled the city of Las-Anod since late December. Most civilians have fled, he said. Sugulle accused Somaliland forces of destroying the hospital’s laboratory, blood bank and patient ward in mortar attacks. “The Somaliland forces who are positioned outside the town have been shelling civilian residents and medical facilities indiscriminately. No single day passes without shelling and casualties,” he told the AP by phone. Somaliland’s Defence Ministry has denied shelling the hospital, and the government has asserted it has a “continuous commitment” to a cease-fire it declared on February 10. “Indiscriminate shelling of civilians is unacceptable and must stop,” the United Nations (UN) and international partners warned last month. Somaliland separated from Somalia three decades ago and seeks international recognition as an independent country. Somaliland and the Somali State of Puntland have disputed Las-Anod for years, but the eastern city has been under Somaliland’s control. The UN mission in Somalia and the UN human rights office had said the violence in Las-Anod killed at least 80 people between December 28 and February 28 and more than 450 non-combatants were wounded, including medical personnel. The UN has called for respect for medical workers and unhindered humanitarian access. Somaliland’s government has blamed the unrest on fighters with “anti-peace groups and terrorism” and alleged that the al-Shabab extremist group, affiliated with al-Qaeda, has supported some attacks. --AP--
