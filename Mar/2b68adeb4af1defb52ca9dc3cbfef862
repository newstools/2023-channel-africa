This comes as the utility reported a Ksh37.65 billion ($294.14 million) expenditure on expensive power in the 12 months to June 30, 2022, as discussions on whether to terminate long-term power purchase agreements with independent power producers falter. Kenya Power, 50.08% owned by the State, says in its annual report (2022) that it has obtained an extension of on-lent debt repayment moratorium approved by the National Treasury amounting to Ksh25.12 billion ($196.25 million) to June 30, 2024. The repayment date was June 30, 2023. Another Ksh5.7 billion ($44.53 million) debt moratorium granted by the National Treasury in 2020 expired in June 2022, with full repayment principal and interest expected to start in July 2022. The company remained in a negative position of Ksh55.74 billion ($435.46 million) as of June 30, 2022.  --TheEastAfrican--
