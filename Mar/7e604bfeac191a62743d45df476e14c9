Unidentified gunmen attacked the Gouande military base in the Altacora Departement near the border with neighbouring Togo and Burkina Faso. The attack happened between 04h00 and 07h00 CAT. Benin, like Togo, has seen increased cross-border incursions from militants based in Burkina Faso since the middle of 2022. There has been no official statement from the authorities about casualties or ongoing operations by the army following the attack, the website said. --BBC--
