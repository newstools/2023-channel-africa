His lawyer told the media that Soumare was summoned by police on Thursday over his letter to the President about the alleged donation. In the letter, Soumare had asked Sall whether he had donated $12.7m to a "French political figure" whose party is distinguished "by hatred and rejection of others". The Senegalese government on Tuesday denied making any financial donation to the leader of France's National Rally, Le Pen, who visited Sall on January 18. It "rejected and condemned" the insinuations and described them as "cowardly and unfounded", according to a statement. --BBC--
