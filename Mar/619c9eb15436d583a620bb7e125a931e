Gwengwe said in a budget speech to Parliament that the higher deficit was partly driven by spending on civil servants' salaries. Economic growth is expected to reach 2.7% in 2023, up from a forecast of 2.6% given at a mid-term budget review in November, before rising to 3.4% in 2024, the Minister said, adding increases in agricultural output and a stabilisation of the energy and mining sectors would underpin growth. --Reuters--
