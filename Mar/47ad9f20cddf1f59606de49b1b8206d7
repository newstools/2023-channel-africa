A humanitarian group, Alarm Phone, said they would have survived if Europe had not decided to let them drown. The charity said it alerted the authorities in Libya, Italy, and Malta after it had been contacted by migrants on the boat on Saturday. The Italian coastguard said the vessel was in the Libyans' search and rescue zone but was difficult to reach because of bad weather. The Libyans said they had no available boats to send. Italy's right-wing government, led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, is facing sharp criticism for failing to act promptly to save the migrants.  --BBC--
