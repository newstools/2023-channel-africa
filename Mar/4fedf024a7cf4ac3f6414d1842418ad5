Seventy-two-year-old Musili Musembi is said to have been trampled on by an elephant as he walked home on Wednesday night. Human-wildlife conflicts are common in the area that borders the vast Tsavo East National Park, with residents complaining of attacks and destruction of their crops by wildlife. In 2020, the deceased is said to have fought off a hyena that attacked his livestock, sustaining an injury on his left hand. On Thursday, angry residents demanded a meeting with the Minister in charge of wildlife. They also wanted the Kenya Wildlife Service to put down the rogue elephant. Police are said to have fired in the air to disperse the residents to retrieve Musembiâ€™s body, which was later taken to a hospital mortuary in Kibwezi town. --BBC--
