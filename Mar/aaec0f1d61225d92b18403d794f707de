He will meet with donor countries and borrowers. Speaking with reporters at the US Treasury Department, Banga said he believes the scientific evidence on climate change, and underscored the need for the bank to continue to work on poverty reduction and inequality, while also tackling the "intertwined" challenges posed by climate change. "You cannot have economic prosperity without caring about nature, pandemics, fragility, food availability, this is our new world," Banga said. "You need to understand that the challenges are multiplied and are multipolar." Biden last week nominated Banga, 63, to head the World Bank, betting the India-born executive's ties to the private sector and decades of experience in emerging markets will bring fresh momentum to a US-led push to overhaul the 77-year-old institution to better address climate change. Banga, now a US citizen, would replace outgoing President David Malpass, who announced his resignation last month after months of controversy after he fumbled an answer on whether he accepted the scientific consensus on climate change, and escalating pressure by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen for him to adopt "bolder and more imaginative" reforms at the bank. Banga said he had already won support from India, Ghana, and Kenya, but hoped to visit as many countries around the world "as logistically possible" over the next three weeks to understand their priorities and concerns so he could "hit the ground running" if he was elected.  --Reuters--
