Ayesha Khairat al-Shater and her husband were given 10 years each. Her father was the Muslim Brotherhood's first nominee for President in 2012 before he was replaced by Mohamed Morsi. She was arrested in 2018 and charged with misuse of social media and promoting terrorist ideas. Amnesty International and other rights groups had described her detention as arbitrary and campaigned for her release. The State Security Criminal Court acquitted one woman. --BBC--
