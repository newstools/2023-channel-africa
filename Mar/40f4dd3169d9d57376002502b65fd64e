Teny, the wife of South Sudan's Deputy President, Riek Machar, is the country’s Defence Minister. Last Friday, she was sacked by President Salva Kiir, who has not officially explained why he fired her. Since independence in July 2011, Teny has remained a staunch member of the opposition, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement In Opposition , a principal party to the 2018 Peace Agreement. The agreement stipulates that South Sudan must have 35% women's representation in government and the private sectors. The question that arises is whether or not women are now fully represented in South Sudan’s government decision-making positions. Providing the answer, Teny said, "No, I don’t think women are fully represented. Before, we had 25% representation for women, although the government and all the parties that are participating in the government try their best to represent women in decision-making positions and in the executive, in the parliament at the State level and any other sectors. “In this government of National Unity, we are observing that the 35% affirmative action is not fully implemented. Apart from that, we also see that there is not much concern about representing women or putting women at the table of decision-making in other sectors like the banking sector, private sector, and foreign service. At this juncture, it may be pertinent to bring to light the fact that South Sudan’s 2011 Constitution makes it clear that all levels of government shall promote women’s participation in public life and their representation in the legislative and executive organs by at least 25% as an affirmative action to redress imbalances created by history, customs, and traditions.  -- JamesShimanyula/ChannelAfrica-- Today is international women’s Day , tag any woman and show them love ❤️ #InternationalWomenDay2023 pic.twitter.com/7JSMiaj0vD Happy International Women's Day to every woman❤️.
