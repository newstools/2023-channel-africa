Macron landed in the Congolese capital, Brazzaville, just before 5 pm (local time), on the third leg of his voyage after visiting Angola and Gabon. He met with President Denis Sassou-Nguesso in Brazzaville before travelling to Kinshasa, the capital of the DRC, which lies on the opposite bank of the Congo river. At an appearance before journalists, Sassou-Nguesso listed sites Macron could visit on a longer trip in the future, likely to be seen as a barb at the short length of the French head of state's stay. In the Angolan capital Luanda, Macron held talks with his counterpart, Joao Lourenco, calling the oil-rich country a "strategic partner in the region". Macron, who chaired an economic forum attended by more than 50 French companies, said the "heart of this visit is the strengthening of agricultural partnerships" with Angola. France was seeking to "build a balanced and reciprocal partnership" with Angola. "This fits in with the idea I have of this economic partnership between the African continent and France," Macron said. "Mindsets have changed," he said. France has for decades been involved in the petroleum industry in the Portuguese-speaking southern African country, which is one of the continent's top crude producers. Macron's visit offered an opportunity to explore cooperation in other sectors. The two governments penned an agreement to boost Angola's agricultural sector, particularly "climate resilience and water security", in addition to helping revamp coffee, soya, cotton, and dairy production, among other sectors. The goal should be to develop a "made-in-Africa strategy", he said. --AfricaNews--
