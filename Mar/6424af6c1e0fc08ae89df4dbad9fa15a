The 76-year-old made a brief appearance in the Wynberg Magistrates' Court in Cape Town, Western Cape Province on Thursday. Wearing a dark grey suit, he looked frail and used a cane to help him walk. He is accused of molesting a pupil in SA nearly 40 years ago. The retired teacher has yet to enter a plea since his arrest in December, when this allegation against him was made. He has been referred to in the South African media as "Mr P", following a court order that he cannot be named. Mr P is also wanted in the UK in connection with at least 42 charges of sexual abuse by former pupils of two prestigious boys' schools in the UK between 1970 and 1990, allegations he has denied. In 2018, UK authorities wrote to SA’s Justice Ministry to request that he be extradited to face the charges. Mr P, who lives in an upmarket retirement village in Cape Town’s Rondebosch suburb, is fighting the extradition. According to his court papers, the accusations by UK prosecutors are "too broad, vague… and embarrassing". Another reason for the delay in the extradition process has been a question of jurisdiction. Local courts need to determine if South Africa and the UK are still bound by an extradition treaty, which was in place when the UK was still part of the European Union. Mr P has argued that the treaty lapsed after Brexit. SA’s prosecutors are trying to get the courts to review the argument on jurisdiction. The retired teacher was arrested after a pupil, identified as "Luke" - which is not his real name - reported the alleged abuse to Cape Town police after a BBC documentary aired in SA. The pupil alleged that when Mr P was a teacher in Cape Town, he repeatedly sexually molested him. --BBC--
