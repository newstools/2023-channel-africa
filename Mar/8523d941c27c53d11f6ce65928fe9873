No explanation was given for the dismissal of Mayiik Ayii Deng, which was announced in a decree on the State television. The sacked Minister is an ally of Kiir, and previously served as the Minister in the President's office. Last week’s sackings have threatened to derail a peace deal with opposition leader First Vice-President Riek Machar. The opposition called for the reinstatement of Angelina Teny, who Kiir dismissed as Defence Minister and handed the position to his party. Teny is also Machar’s wife. The United Nations called for the parties to "exercise restraint and engage in a collegial spirit in order to resolve such sensitive national issues”. --BBC--
