The registration process begins on Sunday, ahead of this year's harmonised elections, with Bulawayo having 71 centres. The mobile voter registration exercise ends on March 21. A total of 4 474 have been identified for the programme. ZEC on Thursday released a schedule detailing where its team will be deployed during the programme. At least 5.8 million Zimbabweans have registered to vote and ZEC will be conducting the last round of mobile voter registration before the elections. President Emmerson Mnangagwa recently announced that he will soon proclaim the election date following last month's gazetting of the new delimitation report. In a statement, ZEC Acting Chief Elections Officer Jane Chigidji said the new mobile registration centres also identify the renamed constituencies. "It is hereby notified for general information that the ZEC will be carrying out a mobile Biometric Voter Registration (BVR) exercise from March 12-21 in preparation for the Harmonised Elections," she said. Chigidji said the public should present a national identity card with the holder's picture when going to register. Political parties and civil society organisations urged members of the public to register to vote. Zanu-PF Matabeleland South Vice Chairperson Albert Nguluvhe said the party will take advantage of the mobile voter registration exercise to mobilise the public to register to vote. He said the elections give citizens an opportunity to elect their leaders and exercise democratic rights. --Herald-- ZEC Mobile voter registration centreshttps://t.co/bFStA8PWPQ Zanu PF primary elections date set https://t.co/uUDboq6ewF ZANU PF Set To Hold Primary Elections Next Week https://t.co/ucL1V2ja2w via @zimtimesonline pic.twitter.com/k2EG8hT3sh WATCH : Chamisa says Mnangagwa is mobilizing military ahead of Zimbabwe 2023 elections. https://t.co/rGu2KJ4Jwz pic.twitter.com/0QdTrIfqqE
