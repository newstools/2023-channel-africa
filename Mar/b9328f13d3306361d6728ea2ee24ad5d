"The people of Taiwan should be governed within Taiwan by a government they elect themselves in fair and free elections, with no external pressure," Dlamini said during a meeting with President Tsai Ing-wen. Dlamini also thanked the Taiwan government for its decades-long support of Eswatini. Eswatini is the only African State and one of 14 countries worldwide that maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan, which China regards as a breakaway province. Taiwan and Eswatini are set to celebrate 55 years of diplomatic ties in September. --BBC--
