The storm, according to meteorologists, is moving at a speed of 13 km/h towards the south-west coast of Madagascar, and could reach the severe tropical storm stage this Monday. Mozambique's National Institute of Meteorology has predicted continued heavy rains (more than 200mm in 24 hours) over the ocean and winds of up to 110km/h, accompanied by gusts of up to 150km/h, which could disturb the sea generating waves that are about 10ft (3m) tall. The agency has warned people to take precautionary and safety measures. --BBC--
