The Flintlock 2023 drills, a two-week training, are being staged in Ghana and Ivory Coast. On Thursday, the troops were in Accra, on board Spanish navy ship Audaz. "The benefits to Ghana and its neighbouring countries from this specific training is to not only prepare our African partner nations for maritime security operations, but to foster the inter-operability and collective security that we are trying to aim for with exercise Flintlock," a US major said. Thursday's training saw troops learning how to conduct anti-piracy operations. Spain’s Ambassador to Ghana Javier Gutiérrez said the partnerships with West African countries were strategic, adding "events in the region have a direct impact on Europe." "We have been cooperating for many years and with countries like Ghana, we are contributing to facing common challenges like terrorists and piracy and at the same time building local capacities. We believe that these are activities for mutual benefits of both parties and we're co-operating with our partners like Ghana." Terrorist insurgencies have destabilised countries in the region like Burkina Faso and Mali. The training will run until March 15. Twenty nine nations and over a thousand personnel have participated in Flintlock so far this year. Flintlock, the largest annual US–Africa Command special operations exercise, has taken place annually since 2005. --Africanews--
