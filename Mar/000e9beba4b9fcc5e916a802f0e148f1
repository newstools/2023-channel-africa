Countries in the region are being found wanting of wanton abuse and disregard of workers’ Rights among other violations with countries like Malawi lagging behind in negotiating and workers facing intimidation. "In Botswana, the establishment of the collective bargaining council has been derecognised, and the right to strike has been taken away from Public Service workers. We are concerned of the lack of any collective bargaining processes in Mauritius and the Island of Rodrigues. In Mozambique to date the government has refused to register a Trade Union for Public Service Workers" says Tichaona Fambisa, PSI Sub Regional Secretary for Southern Africa. However, despite some glaring episodes in the region, PSI through Fambisa has stood to praise Zambia for the respect of law rights of its public service employees. "I feel even other countries that are not respecting their workers, their staff, should emulate from Zambia. Currently we just received a 10.5 salary increment" notes Grucewell Makhondo, the Zambia’s PSI representative and Chairperson.  --DaviesSikopo/ChannelAfrica--
