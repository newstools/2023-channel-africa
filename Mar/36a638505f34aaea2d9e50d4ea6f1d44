Greek Antetokounmpo and Swede Forsberg join an ownership group that also includes actress Reese Witherspoon and Tennessee Titans running back Derrick Henry. "My father was a professional football player, and it was the first sport I fell in love with in Greece,” said Antetokounmpo, in a statement on the Nashville SC website. "I’ve always had the dream of owning a football team. "When my brothers and I explored Nashville SC, we knew it was a team and a city that we wanted to get involved with." The Antetokounmpo ownership share is a family affair with his brothers Thanasis, Kostas and Alex, who also play professional basketball, involved. In their fourth season Nashville SC opened the 2023 campaign last Saturday with a 2-0 win over New York City FC. "Football is a global sport, and our newest owners once again reinforce our club’s commitment to being a global team,” said Nashville SC Principal Owner John Ingram. "Filip and Giannis are not just amazing athletes, they are ambassadors for their respective sports, role models for millions and advocates in their home towns and worldwide." --Reuters--
