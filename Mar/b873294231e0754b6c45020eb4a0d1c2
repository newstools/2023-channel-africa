It came a week after President Kais Saied called for a crackdown on sub-Saharan African migrants, which has sparked mass repatriations and attracted global criticism. Jabeur shared a picture of a Tunisian stamp from 1961 celebrating Africa Day. Saied last week said that illegal migration from sub-Saharan Africa was causing "demographic" changes in the country, and accused migrants of being behind rising crime. He said those who were there illegally would not be allowed to stay. His remarks were criticised by rights groups as racist, but the president said those accusing him were seeking to sow discord with Tunisia’s neighbours. Dozens of Guineans and Ivorians have sought refuge in their countries' embassies, and some have reported being physically assaulted following the president’s remarks.  --BBC--
