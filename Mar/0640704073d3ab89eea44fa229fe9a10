As a junior, Mary Ngugi received her training and education at a mixed-gender camp, meaning the 34-year-old, a two-time gold medalist at the World Half Marathon Championships, has seen first-hand the problems young girls can face as they look to build a career in the sport they love. "Being abused by men, harassed, intimidated, and not being able to be themselves," she lists for BBC Sport Africa. "Some are getting pregnant, dropping out of camp because maybe the coaches or the pacers are trying to harass them." So Mary has launched her new initiative, Nala Track Club. "Nala is an African name for a powerful woman or a lioness. We want these girls to be that: strong, powerful, empowered, someone who can say No, I'm not doing that. "I'm trying to give these girls a safe place so they can be themselves," she adds. "I've always wanted to change what is happening, not just in athletics but also in society." Nala, which opened in October 2022, currently supports eight girls, aged between 14 and 22. It is located in Nyahururu Town, a four-hour drive from the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. When BBC Sport Africa visits late in the afternoon, five of the girls arrive soon after, chit-chatting among themselves following a day at school. After a quick debrief on how lessons went, they change into their training kit. Mary, who has a daughter of her own, tells them to stop giggling - for her it is important they learn to have a proper voice of their own. "At home, it's the father who decides what to do, or the brothers. But when these girls are at camp they have the confidence to be themselves." --BBC--
