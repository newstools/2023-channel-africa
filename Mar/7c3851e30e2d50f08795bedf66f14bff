The move clears the way for President Cyril Ramaphosa to appoint a new second-in-command. The resignation comes ahead of Ramaphosa’s expected cabinet reshuffle. "Mabuza has undertaken the responsibilities of his office with dedication. I am grateful for the support he has provided to me throughout his term and for the leadership he has provided to the work of government," says Ramaphosa in a statement. "His contribution has been valued by the many constituencies with which he has engaged, including traditional leaders, military veterans, civil society formations, and international bodies. “As leader of Government Business, he has ably managed the relationship between the executive and parliament, working to ensure that the transformative legislative programme of this administration is advanced,"says Ramaphosa.  --SABC--
