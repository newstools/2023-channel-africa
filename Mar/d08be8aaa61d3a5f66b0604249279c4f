He met with the International Federation of Football Association (FIFA) President, Gianni Infantino, on the sidelines of the Best FIFA Football Awards. "So we talked about how to develop and detect the talents of our young Burundian players, so that they can access the whole world," Muyengye said. "We talked about the sports infrastructure. Having young kids play football is one thing, but having infrastructure is another. These two things go hand in hand to be able to develop the football we want for all." Both officials also touched on the growth of the womenâ€™s game and the support provided by the FIFA Forward program. Burundi is the 141st team in the FIFA world rankings out of 211.  --AfricaNews--
