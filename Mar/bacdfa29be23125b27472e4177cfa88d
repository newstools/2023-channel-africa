Second seed Tsitsipas told reporters on Wednesday that he did not expect to make a deep run at the tournament due to his ailing shoulder and it was unclear how much he had left in the tank after he was blanked in the first set tie-breaker. But the Greek battled back in the second and pumped up the crowd ahead of the third set tie-break. But overly aggressive play in it, including a forehand on match point that missed the line by the slimmest of margins, was his undoing. A beaming Thompson fired a ball high into the air in celebration after he notched his first win over Tsitsipas in three career meetings and second over a top 10 player. "Tricky match point," Thompson told reporters. "The ball was only just out and it was a relief that it was. It was a great feeling. You could see it on my face at the end of the match. I was overcome with joy." --Reuters--
