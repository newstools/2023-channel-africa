General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, Commander of Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF), said his conflict with other military leaders, which has become public in recent weeks, is centered on the issue of handing over power to civilians. “We are against anyone who wants to be a dictator,” he told RSF troops at a military base in the capital of Khartoum. Sudan was plunged into chaos after a military coup removed a Western-backed government in October 2021, stalling its short-lived transition to democracy after nearly three decades of autocratic rule under President Omar al-Bashir. The coup came more than two years after a popular uprising forced the removal of al-Bashir and his Islamist government in April 2019. --APNews--
