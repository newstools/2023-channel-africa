The volume of crude oil spilled caused by sabotage in the Delta fell to 600 tons from 3 300 tons the previous year, Shell said in its annual report. The number of such spills fell to 75 from 106. "The decreased number of incidents in 2022 correlates with a shutdown of production for about six months because of an unprecedented increase of crude oil theft from the Trans Niger Pipeline (TNP)," Shell said. Shell is the operator of Nigeria's main onshore oil and gas joint venture SPDC which has struggled for years with operational incidents, theft and sabotage. --Reuters--
