This comes as preparations for 2023 harmonised elections gather momentum following the recent conclusion of the delimitation exercise. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) will run a 10-day voter registration campaign, which ends on March 21, before undertaking various other activities, including opening the voters’ roll for public inspection, which will lead up to the elections. Eligible voters will, however, still be able to register until two days after proclamation of the election date by President Emmerson Mnangagwa. ZEC has since tabled a $130 billion budget to conduct the polls, with Treasury expected to start disbursing the funds. According to ZEC’s preliminary 2023 elections roadmap, the polls management body is preparing for an extensive post-delimitation awareness programme to explain to the electorate the new electoral boundaries. This process will lead to other routine electoral procedures such as accreditation of observers and the media, the production of the voters’ roll, the constitution of the nomination court, and the establishment of the Multi-Party Liaison Committee. ZEC Chief Elections Officer Utloile Silaigwana said preparations for the harmonised elections had commenced. "The commission will undertake a nationwide mobile voter registration exercise from March 12 to 21, 2023, as it normally does before any general election," he said.  --ZimbabweMail-- Register to vote at any of our 73 centres ,check your registration details on https://t.co/0yXRKWr4Cm or dial *265# on a netone number.#YourVoteYourRight pic.twitter.com/e9xsLzTEQC Mobile voter registration commenced today.
