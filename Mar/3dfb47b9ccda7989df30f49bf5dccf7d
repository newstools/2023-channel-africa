The pressure group, Team Pachedu, found that other co-ordinates provided by the electoral commission pointed to spots in the middle of the Indian Ocean as well as Zambia, eSwatini and South Africa. The activists said the erroneous demarcation of wards would result in candidates campaigning to the wrong audiences and voters not knowing in which constituency their home was located. There has been no word so far from the electoral commission. --BBC--
