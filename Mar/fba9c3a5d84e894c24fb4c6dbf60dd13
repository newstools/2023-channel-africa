The boat, which was carrying 47 people, capsized on Saturday in the seas off Ankazomborona in the north of Madagascar, the Maritime and River Port Agency said in a statement. The agency said the boat had suffered an accident, after which 23 of those on board were saved and 22 bodies had been found. The other two were unaccounted for. A police officer who did not wish to be named said most of those who had been rescued had fled to avoid being apprehended for attempting to travel to Mayotte.  --Reuters--
