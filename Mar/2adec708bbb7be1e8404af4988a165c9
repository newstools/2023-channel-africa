Antonio Guterres has welcomed regional and international efforts led by the Angolan President and the African Union to try to stop a conflict that has displaced hundreds of thousands already. Hours before the ceasefire brokered by Angola takes effect, heavy fighting between the Congolese army and the M23 group has continued in North Kivu province. The UN Secretary General has condemned all violence against civilians and urged all armed groups to lay down their weapons and disarm unconditionally. Guterres has asked the M23 to honour a pledge to cease hostilities to facilitate full and effective withdrawal from areas it has occupied, some near Goma, the biggest city in the east of the country. The ongoing conflict has displaced hundreds of thousands in the past year and led to accusations that Rwanda is funding the rebels, which Kigali denies. --BBC--
