The election is for 28 of the country's 36 Governors, who are among the most influential politicians in Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy and largest oil producer. Some States, such as Lagos, control budgets larger than those of small nations. The Ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party's Bola Tinubu was declared the winner of the presidential election with 39% of the vote. But he lost in his home State of Lagos to opposition candidate Peter Obi of the Labour Party, which is aiming to upset the APC again in the State. Lagos is important for Tinubu because it is where he built his political and financial powerbase, serving two terms as governor until 2007 and playing a key role in picking every successor since. Losing Lagos could erode Tinubu's influence in the State, of more than 20 million people. "It will send a big signal of political vulnerability if the first Lagos state race the APC loses is one where Tinubu is President-elect," said Ikemesit Effiong, head of research at security consultancy firm SBM Intelligence. "It is unprecedented that the party of a sitting Nigerian president doesn't control his home Sstate. Tinubu, through the APC and its predecessor parties, has always been in charge of Lagos politics." Lagos is the commercial hub of Africa's biggest economy, has a flourishing tech sector, generates the most revenue in Nigeria, and has the continent's biggest deep-sea seaport. It is also where Africa's richest man Aliko Dangote is building a multi-billion dollar oil refining complex. Buoyed by Obi's performance in Lagos, the Labour Party's Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, an architect and political activist, will battle it out with APC incumbent Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who has been in the ranks of the Lagos state government for two decades. --Reuters--
