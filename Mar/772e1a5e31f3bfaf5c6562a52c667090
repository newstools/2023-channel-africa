Two other players were taken to hospital for emergency treatment after they got injuries during the weekend tournament. A football federation official was quoted as saying that the teams were having a friendly match when it began to rain. "It is quite unfortunate that they lost their lives while playing a game that they loved most. “As federation officials, we send our condolences to the affected families," the Daily Nation quoted the local Football Kenya Federation Chairperson Evans Akang’a as saying. The official urged the authorities to install lightning arrestors in public areas, including schools where matches take place, in order to reduce such incidents.  --BBC--
