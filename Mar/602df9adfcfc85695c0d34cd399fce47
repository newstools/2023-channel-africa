Ruto said the country cannot condone the Supreme Court ruling last month that upheld the LGBTQ community's right of association. “We should not even try to talk about LGTBQ. This is a conversation we should not even have in our country because accepting it is like throwing our morals into the dustbin,” she said on Sunday. Homosexuality remains criminalised in Kenya. The Supreme Court ruled that refusal to allow the LGBT community to register lobby groups in Kenya would violate their right to association, as provided in the Kenyan constitution. However, the ruling was met with protests from President William Ruto, as well as religious leaders in Kenya. Kenya’s Attorney-General said the government will challenge the court’s ruling, insisting that the issue is a matter for public consultations rather than for the courts. --BBC--
