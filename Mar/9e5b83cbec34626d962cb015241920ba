The West African cocoa-producing nation has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 32% and increasing the share of renewable energy in its energy mix to over 40% by 2030. The agreement is part of a master plan to develop production facilities that integrate solar power, hydroelectricity, and biomass. "Masdar and the Ivorian Ministry of Mining, Petroleum, and Energy will explore the joint development of solar photovoltaic plants in CÃ´te d'Ivoire, starting with a first 50-70 MW plant," the company said in a statement. Masdar aims to deliver 100 gigawatts of green energy around the world by 2030 and sees "enormous potential" for this sector in Africa, it added. In January, it signed an agreement with Ethiopia for the joint development of a 500-MW solar project. It also signed agreements with Angola, Uganda, and Zambia to develop renewable energy projects.  --Reuters
