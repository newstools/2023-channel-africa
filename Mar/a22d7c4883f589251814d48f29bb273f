Royal Cost Marine (RCM), the company that owns the Esther Miracle ferry, said on Facebook that the vessel sprang a leak as it was travelling from Port-Gentil to the capital, Libreville, in the early hours of Thursday morning. In a message posted on Thursday afternoon, the firm said 121 people had been rescued so far and taken to hospitals in Libreville. The AFP news agency quoted officials as saying 151 passengers and crew had been on-board, meaning 28 people are still missing. RCM said operations to find further survivors were continuing. "The search is continuing but if at nightfall we don't find anyone, we will sadly have to consider the strong probability that those missing have died," AFP quotes Public Prosecutor Andre Patrick Roponat as saying. Relatives of those on board are gathered by the quayside in Libreville waiting for news, AFP reports. "My daughter called me in the middle of the night to say that something was going on," a man in his 50s is quoted as saying. "She said: 'Dad, we're sinking', and then there was no more," he said. --BBC--
