The S&P Global SA Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.5 in February from 48.7 in January. A reading above 50 reflects growth. "The latest SA PMI helped to allay fears of a renewed downturn in the private sector economy, after a rocky start to the year saw the headline index hit a 13-month low," said David Owen, Senior Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. "However, while output levels stabilised in February, they did so after contracting at a solid pace," Owen added. Surveyed firms reported a slight recovery in purchasing levels, but the outlook for future activity worsened further, and firms cut employment for the first time in a year, the PMI showed.  --Reuters--
