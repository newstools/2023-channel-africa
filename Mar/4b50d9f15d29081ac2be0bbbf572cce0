The visit to Tunis by Embaló, who is also the Chairperson of Ecowas, came amid ‘racist’ attacks targeting sub-Saharan migrants in the north African nation. During a national security council last month, Saied linked undocumented immigrants to violence and crimes. From the Carthage palace, he denied racism insisting on his will to uphold the law. "There is the Tunisian State, the sovereign Tunisian legality concerning the status of foreigners, even though they are our brothers, they may not have Tunisian nationality, but they are our brothers. I believe that any country wouldn't accept parallel jurisdictions to the State's jurisdictions." Rights groups have  reported a spike in vigilante violence including stabbings of black Africans, since the Saied’s initial comments while migrants say they have been thrown out of their dwellings en masse and handed over to "mob justice". Students and economic migrants from countries such as Guinea, Mali and Ivory Coast fleeing Tunisia were repatriated in recent days. Earlier this week, Tunisian authorities announced measures to "improve conditions of foreigners” in Tunisia and ease procedures" for those seeking to put things right". Embaló gave credence to the thesis of a misinterpretation of Saied speech. "I wouldn't believe that you, the President of Tunisia, the country of Bourguiba, could be xenophobic or racist. You yourself are African”. Saied replied, “I am indeed, and a proud African." The African Union issued on February 25 a statement urging all member States to "treat all migrants with dignity wherever they come from" and "refrain from racialised hate speech that could bring people to harm." Tunisia's Foreign Ministry rejected the statement, saying it contains "baseless terms and accusations" and was built on "a misunderstanding of positions of the Tunisian authorities." --Africanews--
