Usman Khawaja top scored for the tourists with a majestic 180, while Cameron Green (114) registered his maiden test hundred. Ravichandran Ashwin (6-91) was the pick of the bowlers for India, who lead the series 2-1. Khawaja and Green were the bedrock of Australia's innings with a 208-run stand for the fifth wicket, the highest partnership from either side in the bowler-dominated series. Khawaja's batting masterpiece was spread over 10 hours during which the opener faced 422 balls, the most by an Australian batter in India, hitting 21 fours. India, who lead the series 2-1, were 36 for no loss in reply with Rohit Sharma (17) and Shubman Gill (18) seeing off the final 10 overs of the day. The home side trail by 444 runs in the match, which they need to win to seal their place in the final of the World Test Championship against Australia in June.  --Reuters--
