Surveys in 10 countries in Africa and two in the Middle East that are worst affected by the food crisis were used in a United Nations Children's Fund report, released Tuesday, a day before International Womenâ€™s Day. Poor nutrition in pregnant and breastfeeding women can lead to weak immunity and complications during pregnancy and birth. Some countries in sub-Saharan Africa have in previous studies recorded high infant mortality rates due to various complications. Globally, 51 million children under 2 years old are too short for their age due to malnutrition, a condition called stunting, and half of these become stunted during pregnancy or within their first six months of life, the report states. --APNews--
