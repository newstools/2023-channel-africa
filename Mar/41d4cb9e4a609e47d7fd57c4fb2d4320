The deployment followed the killing of a young soldier allegedly stabbed to death by unknown assailants in the area. Social media users have been sharing pictures and videos of alleged soldiers' brutality during the operation. "If decent, innocent residents of Ashaiman were caught up in these operations, I, in my capacity as Deputy Defence Minister, I apologise for that, " Amankwa-Manu said in an interview with a local TV. "It is only proper that we admit when there are excesses in operations of this nature. But we are not going to apologise for [undertaking] the operations." Amankwa-Manu said the operation was sanctioned by the military high command “to bring to book the perpetrators of this heinous crime”. A local Member of Parliament said about 72 people were arrested in the operation. The Ghana Armed Forces is yet to comment on the matter. --BBC--
