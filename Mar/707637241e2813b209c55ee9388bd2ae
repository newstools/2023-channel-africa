According to Simplyflying.com, the airline plans to boost its regional operations as routes around Africa have proven more profitable and essential for developing aviation in the continent. The plan is to replace the Bombardier CRJ900s and possibly the DHC-8-Q400s with more Airbus A330s and Boeing 737s. RwandAir currently has a fleet of 11 operational aircraft, which it flies to its destinations in Europe, Asia, and East, West, and Southern Africa. In a recent interview with AviaDev, RwandAir CEO Yvonne Manzi Makolo said they have a very diversified fleet but want to rationalize it. "We are looking at expanding the B737 fleet and the A330 fleet. We are working on phasing out the CRJs and are discussing regional aircraft, the Q400s as well, whether to continue with that or to look for alternatives." The airline is set to receive an Airbus A330, which will add more capacity, given that last year it split London from Brussels and started operating direct flights from London to Kigali. RwandAir needs more widebody jets as it plans to launch a Paris-tagged route to Brussels. The A330 will also be deployed on the Dubai route to support both passengers and cargo. --TheCitizen--
