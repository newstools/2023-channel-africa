The horrific crash claimed 40 lives and 80 people were seriously injured when two buses collided in Central Senegal on Sunday. Ramaphosa has assured the outgoing African Union chairperson and Senegalese President Macky Sall that South African thoughts and prayers are with the West African nation as it mourns those who perished. In a tweet, the Senegalese Presidentâ€™s office said that the Interministerial Council on Road Safety, held on Tuesday, has carried out an "uncompromising diagnosis" of the situation and would act resolutely according to the Senegalese expectations. It says the government has decided to take 22 "breaking" measures. Experts say road accidents are common in Senegal due to poor roads. --SABC--
