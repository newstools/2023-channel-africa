The current African Union Chairperson, Senegalese President Macky Sall, told the meeting in Dakar that Africa had huge potential that was not exploited. According to the head of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina, two-thirds of the world's uncultivated arable land is in Africa. He said Africa can and must feed itself. Tens of millions of people in East Africa and the Sahel region face hunger because of drought, conflict and a rise in the cost of food and fuel. Leaders attending the meeting have been urged to re-commit to a pledge agreed two decades ago to devote 10% of government budgets to agriculture and rural development. --BBC--
