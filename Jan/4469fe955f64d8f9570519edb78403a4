Vodacom, majority-owned by Britain's Vodafone, said group revenue rose to $1.76 billion in the quarter ended December 31. On a normalised basis, revenue grew 4.7%. Vodafone Egypt was consolidated from December 8, and was a key factor, alongside currency gains, in the 16.1% growth in group service revenue, Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group Chief Executive Officer said. Vodacom bought a 55% stake in the Egyptian arm of Vodafone for $2 494 billion in 2021, the largest deal in the telecoms operator's history. The company's service revenue also benefited from growth in its data and financial services, the fastest growing contributor to the group's suite of new businesses. Financial services revenue jumped 30.6% to reach $149 billion, largely on the back of demand for its mobile money M-Pesa platform across its international portfolio as well as double-digit growth in insurance policy and airtime loan sales in SA, Joosub added. In SA, Vodacom's largest market, service revenue grew 3%, supported by its mobile prepaid business despite electricity availability challenges and consumers battling higher inflation. --Reuters--
