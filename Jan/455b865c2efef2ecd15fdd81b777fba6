The two-year-long war has caused a dire humanitarian crisis, killing tens of thousands, leaving millions in severe need of food, and threatening the stability of Africa's second-most populous country. On November 2, Ethiopia's federal government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a guerrilla force-turned political party that dominates the region, agreed to stop fighting following African Union-mediated talks. A civil war erupted in November 2020 after months of escalating recriminations between the two sides. The TPLF, which dominated Ethiopia for nearly three decades before Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018, accuses his government of wanting to centralise power at the expense of regions. Abiy accuses the TPLF of trying to regain national power. Each side rejects the other's narrative. Human rights violations by all sides, including extrajudicial killings, rapes, and looting, have been documented by United Nations agencies, Ethiopia's state appointed human rights commission, and the media, including Reuters. All sides deny the allegations. The truce has enabled international aid deliveries to resume to parts of Tigray. Last week, state-owned Ethiopian Airlines resumed flights to Tigray's capital. But the prospects for peace remain uncertain. Although Eritrea, a sworn enemy of the TPLF that has fought on the side of Abiy's government, began withdrawing some of its forces from two major Tigray towns last week, it is not yet clear whether its troops will pull out of Tigray altogether. Until they do, diplomats and analysts worry Tigray forces will refuse to disarm, risking a resumption of hostilities. --Reuters--
