Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz appeared in court in Nouakchott with nine other defendants. His lawyers said he rejected the accusations against him and that his arrest at home on the eve of the trial amounted to kidnapping. The former leader stepped down in 2019. He has accused his successor Mohamed Ould Ghazouani of turning the legal system against him. --BBC--
