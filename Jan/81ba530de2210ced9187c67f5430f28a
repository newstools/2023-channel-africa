According to the local government's Facebook page, the probability of widespread flooding will occur on Thursday and Friday. Last year, the province was hit by devastating floods which affected around 40 000 people and left at least 400 people dead. Authorities have since issued flood safety advice, including telling people to avoid crossing low-lying bridges and to take care when driving. The weather services issued a level-nine warning for KZN, which means that there could be a threat to life and displacement of people. --BBC--
