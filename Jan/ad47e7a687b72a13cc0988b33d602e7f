The signing by President Emmerson Mnangagwa comes after health workers were locked in a protracted fight with the government over poor salaries last year. Thousands of nurses and doctors at State-run hospitals in the southern African country went on strike last year, demanding a hefty raise and wages in United States dollars due to a slide in the local currency and steep inflation that eroded the value of their earnings. An exodus of doctors and nurses has left Zimbabwean hospitals understaffed, with over 4 000 health workers leaving the country since 2021, the country's Health Services Board said in November. Many nurses in Zimbabwe earn less than $100 a month. --Reuters--
