Most lives were lost attempting to reach the Canary Islands, but almost 500 went missing on an increasingly popular route from Algeria to Spain's eastern Mediterranean coast. The charity, Caminando Frontreras, says more than 90% of the victims die without their bodies ever being found. It says this has a terrible impact on their families and their communities of origin due to the impossibility of fully mourning as well as legal and psychological implications. --BBC--
