The VP died after a short illness, although Barrow did not mention whether he was receiving treatment in India. Joof was not seen in public for months, reports the BBC's Omar Wally from the capital, Banjul. Barrow picked him as Vice-President VP after being re-elected in December 2021 for a second term. In June, Joof expressed dissatisfaction about the conduct of public affairs, saying Gambians had great expectations and "business as usual" would not lead to decisive change, the BBC reporter adds. --BBC--
