The institution denounced the European Parliament’s use of human rights and “false and baseless” accusations to interfere in Arab states’ judiciary systems. The Arab Parliament also rejected all external attempts to interfere in Arab countries’ affairs, demanding that the European Union(EU) “immediately stop taking a supervisory role on the situation of human rights in Arab states” and to verify the accuracy of the information it gets. The statement also urged the EU Parliament to honour its partnerships and ties with Arab states, especially with Morocco, adding that it should prioritize dealing with issues of immigrants, refugees, and minorities within its own borders. Their statement concluded by urging Members of the European Parliament not to politicize human rights. The condemnation is a response to a resolution passed in the European Parliament that criticized Morocco for alleged human rights and the abuse of free speech, citing the case of journalist Omar Radi who was arrested after a co-worker filed a complaint against him for rape and sexual assault. Several Moroccan public figures and institutions have since come out against the resolution, with many condemning interference in the country’s judiciary affairs and the European Parliament’s downplaying of the accusations facing Radi. --.moroccoworldnews.com--
