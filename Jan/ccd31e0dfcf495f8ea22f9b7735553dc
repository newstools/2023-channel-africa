"That constitutes 8% of the promises," Eddie Jarwolo from the respected Naymote Partners for Democratic Development told the BBC. Fighting corruption, a main factor in Liberia's underdevelopment, was key in Weah’s inaugural address in 2018. However, in the last five years Weah and top officials have instead come under criticism for allegedly amassing wealth and building fabulous private properties, much to the disappointment of their grassroots supporters. There have been frequent reports of shady deals involving key government actors and a lack of accountability on how millions of Dollars of State funds have been spent. Maxson Kpakio from Justice Forum Liberia, an established advocacy group, said he was “hugely disappointed in the Weah administration because for five years we are yet to see foreign direct investments, all we see is corruption and hardships”. The Chairperson of the governing Congress for Democratic Change party, Mulbah Morlue, dismissed the criticisms. He told the BBC that the development achievements of Weah's government "are countless", naming the construction of roads and hospitals. He added that because of Weah's track-record, the re-election of the former football star was certain in October. --BBC--
