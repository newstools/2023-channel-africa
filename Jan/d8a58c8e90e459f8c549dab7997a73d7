The West African gold, oil, and cocoa producer is battling its worst economic crisis in a generation. The local cedi dropped heavily against the Dollar last year as government spending cuts and central bank interest rate hikes failed to tame inflation, which rose to a new high of 54% last month. Trade unions representing public service employees started negotiating salary rises with the government in November, a few months after hardship spurred street protests that pushed the government to seek help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The two parties on Thursday settled on a 30% increase to base pay across board, effective from January 1, 2023. Ghana's government announced sweeping spending cuts in March, including a lowering of ministers' salaries, to reduce the deficit, contain inflation, and slow the cedi's slide. But it also increased the cost of living allowance for public workers by 15% in July, citing the impact of "global challenges" on citizens. Ghana secured a staff-level agreement with the IMF for a $3 billion, three-year support package in December but needs to restructure its debt to access the funds. The government launched a domestic debt exchange programme last month and later said it would default on nearly all of its $28.4 billion of external debts. It asked to restructure its bilateral debt under the G20 common framework platform this week.  --Reuters--
