The Ministry has therefore called upon Malawians to observe good hygiene as the government of Malawi is engaging the World Health Organisation for another donation of the vaccines. Public Relations Officer for the Ministry, Adrian Chikumbe, confirmed the development to the local media. "It is true that we no longer have cholera vaccines. We have used all the vaccines we had. But I would like to urge all Malawians to observe hygiene as we continue the fight against this disease," said Chikumbe. Commenting on the matter, health activist Maziko Matemba has asked government and Non Governmental Organisations to do all they can to ensure that the country gets the vaccines as soon as possible. "The vaccines are very important, and the government should see to it that the country gets them as soon as possible. On the other hand, people should not relax because there are no vaccines but observe cleanliness at all times to avoid the spread of the disease," explained Matemba. Records show that 881 people have died of cholera in the country. --AllAfrica--
