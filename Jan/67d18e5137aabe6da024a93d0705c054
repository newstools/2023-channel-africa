"Sorry, madam, the insecurity issue we have in the Great Lakes region is called Rwanda," he said. Tshisekedi added that "Rwanda is supporting the M23 rebels" to create insecurity in eastern DRC, a claim that Rwanda has denied. He accused the rebels of killing more than 100 civilians in Kishishe to "frighten away" the community from the village, which has "precious minerals in the ground". Tshisekedi also said the M23 has not been respecting a peace accord, which required required the rebels to immediately withdrawal from areas they had captured. "M23 is still there, they act like they are moving, but they are not; theyâ€™re simply moving around and redeploying elsewhere, and they stay in the towns that they have captured," he said. Speaking at a WEF session on Tuesday, Akamanzi told Tshisekedi that "if security is indeed a big problem for you, and clearly if you were able to solve it as the DRC government or DRC army, you would have done it by now." "I believe the solution is in your handsto own the problem but also to work with those who can solve it because security is paramount for investment," Akamanzi added.  --BBC--
