The South African environment department said the first batch of 12 cheetahs would be moved next month. It plans to send a similar number annually for the next eight to 10 years. India received eight cheetahs from Namibia last year and they were released at Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh state. Asian cheetahs became extinct in India in the late 1940s because of excessive hunting and loss of habitat. Some conservationists argue that the translocation of cheetahs may not be successful as reserves in India are close to densely populated villages. --BBC--
