The Comrades Marathon is the world’s largest and oldest ultra-marathon race. This year’s down run takes place on June 11, starting in Pietermaritzburg. According to the Comrades Marathon Association’s Delaine Cools, the window period was a short one. “We had many requests from long-standing runs to please allow them to secure an entry into the race this coming June. The entry process will be for three days or as soon as a number of spots have been taken up.” --SABC--
