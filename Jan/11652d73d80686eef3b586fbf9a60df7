Ivory Coast is the world's top cocoa producer with annual production of about 2.2 million tonnes. Currently about 35-40% is processed in country and the rest exported. The state has signed an agreement with the United Arab Emirates for the construction of a new plant in San Pedro with a grinding capacity of 120 000 tons, said Yves Brahima Kone, Director General of the CCC.
