His body was found two weeks ago dumped in a metal box by the roadside near the town of Eldoret. The government's chief pathologist said he died due to suffocation caused by stuffing of pieces of cloth in his mouth and nose. Friends and family collected his body from a mortuary on Tuesday morning. A family Spokesperson, Gaudencia Tanui, has said everyone is welcome to pay their last respects. Tanui said she was hopeful that Mr Chiloba's killers would be brought to justice and that the homicide department was in constant touch. Five suspects, including Chiloba's partner, are in remand as police conclude investigations before formally pressing charges. Tanui also told the BBC that they were shocked by the social media vitriol directed at the family, which she said had left them deeply hurt. --BBC--
