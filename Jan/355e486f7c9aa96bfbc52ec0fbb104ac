Five years ago, Odinga also challenged the election result and the Supreme Court ordered a re-run. Many of the pages in the 2017 document showing the logs, the technical word for a record of activities on a computer system, appear like those in the current document, sometimes with only the dates changed. Screenshots in the affidavit filed by Githongo and reported to be from a whistle-blower even have the year 2017 appearing among the dates meant to be for August this year. There are also what seem to be simple errors for example, a time given as 16:54:30 pm in the 2017 document appears as 6:54:30 pm in the submission made this week, apparently missing the first digit. BBC Reality Check has discovered that the document posted in 2017 was from Makau Mutua, who is currently the Spokesperson for Odinga’s campaign secretariat. He is challenging results declaring Deputy President William Ruto the winner of the election held earlier this month. According to the electoral commission, Odinga took 48.8% of the vote, compared to Ruto's 50.5%. KenyaPolls @kenyaPollsapp Updated polls results.
