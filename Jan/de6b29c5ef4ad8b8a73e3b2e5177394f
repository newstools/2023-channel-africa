The agreement was announced following talks between the two leaders in South Sudan's capital, Juba, on Thursday. The two countries' defence and Foreign Ministers also attended the talks. Burhan and Kiir also discussed the disputed Abyei region, calling for "regular joint meetings" to resolve the dispute over the territory, the statement added. Kiir also briefed Burhan on the implementation of the 2018 South Sudan peace agreement, of which Sudan is one of the main guarantors.  --BBC--
