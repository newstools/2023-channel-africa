It was imposed by her predecessor, the late President John Magufuli, who argued that in between elections they were a waste of time and money. But it was criticised by the opposition and activists as unconstitutional. Hassan made the announcement during a meeting with leaders from all 19 of the country’s registered political parties. "Our duty as a government will be offering protection for the rallies now that the rallies are back, and I hope we are going to conduct ourselves in a civil and mature way and avoid trading insults," Hassan said. The lifting of the ban is part of the president’s political reconciliation and reform drive, which she initiated after taking power in 2021 following MagufuIi’s death. His period in power was often seen as taking Tanzania down a more authoritarian route. In recent months, the president and her governing Chama Cha Mapinduzi party has been talking with opposition parties behind closed door talks. Speaking on Tuesday, Hassan also said her government would try to restart a stalled constitutional review process. --BBC--
