The regional trade bloc this Wednesday kicked off a verification exercise to assess the country’s readiness to be admitted into the community. Experts from the seven EAC member countries will be in Mogadishu for the next week to establish the country’s level of conformity with the criteria of being admitted to the bloc. The senior officials drawn from Kenya, South Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) will assess Somalia’s legal frameworks, policies, development strategies, infrastructure, peace and security among other things. Following last year’s admission of DRC to the bloc, Somalia has been keen to join the EAC saying it does not want to be "a liability anymore" but wants to contribute positively to the bloc through business, agriculture, blue economy and other sectors. The Horn of Africa country made an unsuccessful bid to join the EAC in 2012. President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud launched a fresh request in July 2022 during EAC’s summit in Tanzania where he was invited as a special guest. Upon completion of the verification mission, a report on the findings will be presented to the EAC Council of Ministers, who will then table it before the heads of states for consideration during a summit expected to be held at end of February 2023. --BBC--
