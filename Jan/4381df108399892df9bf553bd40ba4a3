At 0837 CAT, the Rand traded at 16.9650 against the Dollar, 0.13% weaker than its previous close. Markets were awaiting a speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell later on Tuesday and United States (US) inflation data on Thursday, which could give cues on the likely path of rates this year. "US inflation is expected to drop sharply, which could hold implications for US monetary policy," ETM Analytics said in a research note. "A larger-than-expected drop might quickly soften expectations for further hikes and detract from the Dollar," ETM added. The government's benchmark 2030 bond was almost unchanged in early deals, with the yield at 9.730%. --Reuters--
