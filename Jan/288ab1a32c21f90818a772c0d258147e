In his endorsement, Obasanjo described Obi of the Labour Party as a "mentee" who had an "edge over other candidates." He also described the West African country's current state of affairs as having "moved from [the] frying pan into the  fire and from the mountain top to the valley." Obasanjo ruled Nigeria between 1999 and 2007. But in an angry response, President Muhammadu Buhari's office said the former leader was "being jealous" and represented the "dark days of Nigeria’s democracy." The former president thinks "he is the best ever to lead Nigeria and there will never be another one better than him," a statement from a presidential aide said. Peter Obi is seen as one of the three main contenders. 

The others are Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the ruling APC and Abubakar Atiku of the main opposition PDP. Local outlets quote Tinubu's campaign as saying that their candidate "will not lose sleep" over Obasanjo’s endorsement, while Atiku's camp said the "endorsement of an individual, no matter how highly placed, does not translate to victory at the polls". Campaigns have intensified ahead of the general elections. --BBC--
