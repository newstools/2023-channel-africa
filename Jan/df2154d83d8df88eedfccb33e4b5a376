The wounded are in a critical condition and receiving treatment at a local health facility, the Administrator of Fizi territory in South Kivu Province, said Aime Kawaya Mutipula. Landslides are relatively common in the hilly slopes of Eastern DRC where heavy rains can saturate and loosen soil. But they are more likely to occur if soil has been disturbed by mining, tree felling or construction. In December, intense rains in DRCâ€™s capital Kinshasa caused flooding and landslides that killed around 170 people.
