Opposition parties and human rights organisations accused the troops of killing at least 10 people during protests last week in the town of Las Anod. The demonstrators took to the streets after gunmen killed a politician. The local mayor said military leaders had ordered troops to return to barracks so that the situation could normalise. Las Anod is claimed by Somaliland, which declared independence from Somalia in 1991, as well as by Puntland, a region in northern Somalia. --BBC--
