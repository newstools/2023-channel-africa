Today Abiy was welcomed by the military leader on arrival in the capital city, Khartoum. Ethiopia's state television ETV reported that the prime minister would discuss ways to bolster "all-round relations" between the two countries. Abiy's office said that during the discussions, the Prime Minister shared Ethiopia's "solidarity with Sudan in the political dialogue process that they have embarked upon". Sudan's military and civilian groups have been in long-running negotiations to end the political crisis that followed the October 2021 coup. Relations between Ethiopia and Sudan are thawing after years of tensions over a fertile agricultural land in Al-Fashaga border area and the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. --BBC--
