This follows a Commission of Inquiry that Chakwera commissioned last month into the arrest of Chizuma over her leaked audio. Chizuma was arrested by police on December 6 after a complaint from Kayuni, who said that he was injured due to comments Chizuma made in the audio. In his address to Malawians, Chakwera said he has since replaced Kayuni with Legal Aid Bureau Director Masauko Chamkakala. Commenting on Chizuma, Chakwera observed that he already decided not to fire Chizuma last year after the emergence of the leaked audio. Initially, the commission faulted Kayuni in its report for filing a personal complaint on matters involving his office as DPP while still holding that office, which ChakweraÂ  has described as an act of unsound judgment. "To prevent him from using public office to settle a personal injury, I have removed Kayuni from his position as DPP," says Chakwera. Chakwera further added that this does not mean that people are not allowed to file a complaint against Chizuma; likewise, Chizuma is also free to file a complaint against the person who recorded her against her wishes. --GeorgeMhango/ChannelAfrica--
