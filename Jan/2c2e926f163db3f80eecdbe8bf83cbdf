Kyrgios had pulled out of the United Cup with an injury just minutes before his pre-tournament press conference, drawing the ire of Australian co-captain Lleyton Hewitt, his teammates and the media. The 27-year-old has not played since October and an ankle injury forced him to skip warm-up tournaments in Adelaide as well, before Djokovic offered to play him in a practice match that will be played at Melbourne's Rod Laver Arena. "Wow Nick Kyrgios is bad for the sport! Wow what a disgrace, a national embarrassment! How dare he sell out another stadium, the arrogance," Kyrgios said in a sarcastic tweet on Tuesday. Former American player Noah Rubin questioned the timing of the exhibition match just before a Grand Slam to which Kyrgios responded: "Well to be fair it will bring more crowd than any of your matches." Tickets for the match, a repeat of last year's Wimbledon final, were priced at $14 each with the proceeds going to the Australian Tennis Foundation. The Australian Open begins on Monday. --Reuters-- Wow Nick Kyrgios is bad for the sport! Wow what a disgrace, a national embarrassment!
