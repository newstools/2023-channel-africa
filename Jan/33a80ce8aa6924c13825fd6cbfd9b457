The UN Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (Unitams) said the signatories would on Monday begin a four-day conference to consult on five issues in the political framework agreement. Civilian and military signatories of the political framework agreement, civil society groups, academics, private sector representatives, and religious and traditional leaders will attend the talks. On December 5, the former ruling coalition, Forces for Freedom and Change, and allied political groups signed a framework agreement that provides for a 24-month transition to begin once a new prime minister is appointed. However, powerful pro-military, Islamist groups and pro-democracy activists in the country have rejected the deal. --BBC--
