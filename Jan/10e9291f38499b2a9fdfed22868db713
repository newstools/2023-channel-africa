A local official blamed the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA ) for the attack which happened several days ago and left five police officers dead. The OLA has not commented. The Deputy Mayor of Bule Hora city told the BBC that some of the inmates were members of the OLA. While international attention has focused on the peace deal in Tigray in northern Ethiopia, the security situation continues to deteriorate in parts of Oromia. --BBC--
