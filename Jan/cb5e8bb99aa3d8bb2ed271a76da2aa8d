AFP Sports looks at three talking points from the Champions Cup pool stages. The inclusion of three South African teams in the Champions Cup raised eyebrows among traditional followers of the sport as the competition lost its European exclusivity. During the pool stages, the Stormers travelled 30 hours to Clermont and Bordeaux-Begles took 24 hours to get to Durban to face the Sharks, raising questions over player welfare, the environmental impact of the flights and the lack of away support, a huge part of the competition's history. Stormers come to life in the second half to secure bonus-point win against Clermont Auvergne Last week, it was announced that if the South Africans were to reach the semi-finals, on the weekend of April 28/29/30, they would have to play away from home, following an agreement between the tournament organisers, European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) and South Africa Rugby. Financially, the South African teams have added a sizeable television rights deal to EPCR, which has struggled to attract the big money sponsorship deals of domestic leagues, such as the Top 14. The Stormers and the Sharks secured home ties in the last 16 and the Bulls also advanced, justifying their presence as whispers continue about the South African national team's inclusion in the 'European' Six Nations. French flustered After La Rochelle won the title last season following Toulouse's fifth Champions Cup crown in 2021, some predicted French dominance of the tournament, especially with English club rugby's financial issues. France are the reigning Six Nations champions, starting the defence of their title next month, and are second in the world rankings and contenders for the Rugby World Cup on home soil later this year. Yet this season, French clubs have so far failed to live up to expectations in cross-border competition. --Iol--
