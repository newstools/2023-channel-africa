The army drove al-Shabaab from Galcad on Monday in what it said was a major victory for its forces. But al-Shabaab fighters stormed the town early on Friday and say they are now back in control. The Somali army disputes that and say it's repulsed the attack, though with the loss of one of the commanders of their elite US-trained Danab unit, Major Hassan Mohamed Osman. Both sides claim to have killed dozens of opponents, though such claims are often exaggerated.
