In a post on social media, the military said it had targeted a farm in the Middle Shebelle region, where al-Shabab fighters had moved after they'd attacked a Somali army base on Tuesday. The SNA saidÂ  this Thursday that the raid had been supported by its international partners and local militia. Over the past year, government forces have driven al-Shabab from some of their heartlands. Having recovered swathes of territory in the centre, correspondents say the military may now be preparing to strike against al-Shabab in the south. President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud made the fight against the militants a key pledge in last year's successful election campaign. --BBC--
