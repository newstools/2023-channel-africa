Officials in Safala province said the animals were desperate for water as their regular sources had completely dried up. They said the elephants had been wrecking everything in their path, and some families had had to abandon their homes and move elsewhere. Elephant rampages are an increasing problem in Mozambique and they are leaving conservation areas in search of food and water. The national environmental body says nearly 100 people have been killed by wild animals in the past two years. --BBC--
