Police are still investigating the motive but are not believed to be treating it as a terror related. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin has praised the courage of two off-duty police officers who intervened to halt the attack. The attacker used a metal hook in the incident, hitting the first victim about 20 times, according to the French Public Prosecutor. The injured people include two male passengers aged 36 and 41, three female passengers aged 40, 47 and 53, and a 46-year-old police officer who is part of the border police at the Gare du Nord. “Only the 36-year-old man is still hospitalised at this time” but is not in critical condition,” according to prosecutors. While residents of Paris had begun to relax after several years of heightened tensions around terror attacks, Wednesday’s incident, which currently is not being investigated as terror-related by French authorities, is the second in two months. In December, a man who was being investigated at the time by Paris’ Prosecutor’s Office for racist violence shot and killed three Kurdish activists in the north of Paris. The suspect was shot three times and taken to hospital with serious injuries. --BBC\CNN--
