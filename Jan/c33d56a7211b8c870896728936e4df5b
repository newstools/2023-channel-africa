Obasanjo gave his endorsement in an open letter to young Nigerians on Sunday. "None of the contestants is a saint, but when one compares their character, antecedent, their understanding, knowledge, discipline, and vitality that they can bring to bear and the great efforts required to stay focused on the job, particularly looking at where the country is today and with the experience on the job that I personally had, Obi as a mentee has an edge. Others, like all of us, have what they can collectively contribute to the new dispensation for the liberation, restoration, and salvaging of Nigeria collectively. "One other important point to make about Obi is that he is a needle with thread attached to it from North and South, and he may not get lost," he wrote. Obi is one of the Presidential candidates who had sought the support of Obasanjo. --AllAfrica--
