The drills will run for 10 days from February 17-27 in the port city of Durban and Richards Bay. The aim is sharing operational skills and knowledge, the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) said. South Africa was among African countries that abstained from taking sides in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The country assumed the chairmanship of the Brics group of nations, which brings together Brazil, Russia, India and China, Â last month. This will be the second time such a military drill is taking place. The first was held in November 2019 in Cape Town. "This year's exercise will see over 350 SANDF personnel from various arms of services and divisions participating," said SANDF. --BBC--
