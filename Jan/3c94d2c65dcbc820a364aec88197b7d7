Kinshasa Governor Gentiny Ngobila says the main city centre will be spruced up, with street vendors and abandoned vehicles removed from roads connecting to the Kinshasa International Airport. Last month, the city experienced the worst floods in years, that left more than 120 dead. This is the first time that the city of at least 14 million residents will be hosting Pope Francis. His predecessor, the late Pope John Paul II, visited the country twice, in 1980 and 1985, during the rule of former strongman Mobutu Sese Seko. The majority of the country's population are Catholics. --BBC--
