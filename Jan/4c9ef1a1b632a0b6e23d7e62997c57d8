A Russian research vessel which has been prospecting for oil and natural gas in the Antarctic docked in South Africa (SA) this Saturday following protests by green campaigners who say its operations in the region violate a treaty banning mineral exploration. Earlier this week, several dozen protesters from Greenpeace and Extinction Rebellion demonstrated at the port, saying the ship's seismic surveys in the Antarctic were a threat to marine life in the area and violated a 1958 international agreement. A 1998 amendment to the 55-nation Antarctic Treaty, to which both Russia and SA are signatories, RosGeo, the State-owned Russian exploration company that operates the Akademik Alexander Karpinsky, says it has been conducting research in Russia's designated part of Antarctica since 1970 to explore for hydrocarbons. According to RosGeo's website, the hydrocarbon potential of the designated area is estimated at approximately 70 billion tons. RosGeo did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Extinction Rebellion Representative Cassie Goodman told Reuters that SA's government was being complicit in environmental damage by allowing the Russian ship to dock. SA's Foreign Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. President Cyril Ramaphosa's government has friendly relations with Russia. SA says it is impartial on the Ukraine conflict and has abstained from voting on United Nations resolutions on the war. Earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov visited SA and the two countries along with China are set to conduct a joint military exercise on the African nation's east coast between February 17 and 27. --Reuters--
