Ruto was declared the winner of the Presidential election, taking 50.5% of the vote, amid dramatic scenes at the vote tallying centre. Electoral Commission Chairperson, Wafula Chebukati, said he had done his duty despite receiving threats. On Tuesday, the President claimed the plot to abduct Chebukati was sanctioned by the "highest" office, according to local media reports. "We know that there was a direct attempt to abduct Chebukati and murder him so that the commission would be paralysed, or a compliant commissioner take over and subvert the people’s sovereignty. “It was a hard, cold and lonely time, the threats were dire, the promised rewards lavish and the pressure relentless,” Ruto said. He made the remarks during a meeting with commissions and independent offices at State House, Nairobi. Ruto’s rival at the elections, Raila Odinga’s party, ODM, has scoffed at the remarks, calling it a “well-choreographed chorus". “They should present the claims before a commission of Inquiry when it is formed." --BBC--
