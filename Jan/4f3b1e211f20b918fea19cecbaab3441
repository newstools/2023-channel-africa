A statement posted on Macarthur's official website said the club and Yorke, who was in his first role as a Head Coach and had been appointed in July, "have mutually agreed to part ways, effective immediately". "I want to thank the Chairperson Gino Marra, Chief Executive Officer Sam Krslovic, all the ownership group as well as all the staff and fans of Macarthur FC," Yorke said in the statement. "I leave the football club with a great team that will continue to challenge for more silverware." Yorke led the club to their first-ever trophy when Macarthur won the Australia Cup last year and he leaves with the team in sixth in the A-League following a 1-0 loss against Adelaide United last Friday. "I would like to thank Dwight Yorke and his Assistant Russell Latapy for their contribution towards our club and, in particular, Dwight leading Macarthur to our first silverware with our 2022 Australia Cup triumph," Marra said. --Reuters--
