The AFP news agency reports that voter turnout was low. Opposition parties took part after either boycotting or being excluded from recent polls. "I believe that we are definitively turning the wrong pages of our recent political history," President Patrice Talon said in a statement after voting. He added: "No one is boycotting anymore despite the reforms that are still in progress and which are transforming our political, economic, and administrative environment." The results are expected within the next week, AFP reports. Parties winning more than 10% of the vote will share out the 109 parliament seats, according to a proportional system. --BBC--
