The decision for Eritrea to leave Tigray was reached this week after a delegation of Ethiopian government officials toured Makelle, the capital of the region, for the first time since the signing of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (CoHA). The CoHA was signed by the Ethiopian government and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), labelled as ‘combatants’ on the agreement. But Eritrea which had sided with the Ethiopian government in the war had not signed, something that had been a bone of contention on how to disarm the TPLF. Eritrea’s withdrawal was not made official, but sources told The EastAfrican on Thursday that the troops had been seen crossing back into Eritrea through Sheraro, one of the towns the Eritreans frequently shelled at the height of the war. But this move could not ease the handover of heavy weapons by the TPLF to the Ethiopian National Defence Forces, part of the provisions under the CoHA. The discussions on how that will be conducted were cemented at a meeting between Ethiopian officials and TPLF leaders. Since last week, as parties ironed out disarmament arrangements, crucial services resumed. Frehiwot Tamiru, the Chief Executive Officer of the State-owned, Ethio Telecom, said a phone call was made Wednesday after more than a year of communication blackout. "The restart of telecommunication services in (Mekele) has enabled 61 bank branches to re-enter into service," the state-owned Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation quoted Tamiru. --TheEastAfrican--
