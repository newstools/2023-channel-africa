In a statement, the Angola Foreign Affairs Ministry said the use of "increasingly sophisticated equipment might lead to a greater involvement of the different parties to the conflict and eventually lead to a third world war." The statement also highlighted Angola's historic "friendship ties" with Russia and its "good co-operation ties" with Ukraine. Angola initially abstained from condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but in October last year it voted in favour of a United Nations resolution condemning the annexation of Ukrainian territory by Russia. Earlier this month, Angolan President João Lourenço appealed to Moscow to declare "a definitive and unconditional ceasefire" in Ukraine. Speaking after meeting Lourenço, Lavrov said that Russia and Angola will deepen co-operation despite "the illegal pressure" from the United States and its allies. Unconfirmed reports said that Lavrov might visit Eritrea as the last stop of his African tour that started in South Africa and also took him to Eswatini.  --BBC--
