According to the UK, the portal for the programme billed for February 1, 2023, will only be available to teachers with professionalism in certain subjects. The updated document by the UK DfE has specified the eligibility criteria for non-UK nationals who are interested in acquiring the Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) which will enable them find teaching jobs across the country. In the report, some subjects which are in great demands in the UK will be given utmost priority. It added that under retained European Union (EU) and domestic legislation, teachers from some countries can easily apply for QTS, but others cannot, even if they have equivalent skills and experience. The report further stressed that the new legislation will make this process consistent and fair, as "It will also support the movement of well-qualified teachers to the English workforce." In its report on the latest developments on the visa status and modes of application, the UK said on its website that "A new professional recognition service, called "apply for qualified teacher status in England," will set consistent standards so the qualifications and experience of overseas teachers can be fairly assessed." "It will eventually be open to qualified teachers from all countries outside the UK." "From February 1, 2023, applicants with a teaching qualification from the following countries and regions (Australia, Canada, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Switzerland, Ukraine, and the United States of America) will be able to use the new service to check if they meet the requirements for Qualify Teacher Status and apply." It further explained that applicants with a subject specialisation in languages, mathematics, or science and a teaching qualification to teach 11- to 16-year-olds from Ghana, Nigeria, Singapore, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Jamaica, and India will be able to use the service to check if they meet the requirements for QTS and also apply."  --AllAfrica--
