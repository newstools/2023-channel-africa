This is to provide digital data storage services to businesses across the east, central, and southern Africa region. This is in addition to a $83 million in funding dispersed to the company last year as part of the $300 million commitment announced by the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) in 2021 to help the company expand its operations on the continent. With this additional investment, the company, which operates the region’s largest data centre, kicked off the construction of an additional facility that will more than triple its current capacity to 15 megawatts (MW), a project expected to end by mid-next year. ADC’s Chief Executive, Tesh Durvasula told The EastAfrican that the demand for their services is growing and they won’t be able to sustain it with the current 4.5 MW capacity, which is rapidly getting exhausted, necessitating the expansion. "Our customers are mainly the Africa 500, which are the continent’s largest companies across financial services, healthcare, government, and information, communication, and technology sectors," Durvasula said. "Eventually we will be able to expand to 20 or 25 MW of capacity if we witness a continued growth in demand. The expansion will enable Africa Data Centres clients to grow and scale depending on their requirements."  --TheEastAfrican---
