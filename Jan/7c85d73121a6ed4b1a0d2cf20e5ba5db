Professor Nox Makunga of Stellenbosch University says that 85% of the flora and fauna found in Africa are endemic to the continent and have the potential to treat a variety of diseases.

"Our reliance on plant-based remedies is really part of a longstanding historical tradition. Even nowadays we are still looking for plants, for example, that might be effective against antimicrobial resistance, which is a huge global problem," she said.

However, she adds that due to stigma, Western branded medicines are often preferred over African plant medicine.

"These are remedies that have not necessarily been written down but passed on as an oral tradition. People are nervous to take something without scientific validation."

Makunga is part of a team working to provide the scientific validation of such herbal extracts.

She says there needs to be more investment to commercialise these plants and market them globally.

The interview was part of a special edition of Focus on Africa, guest edited by Professor Thuli Madonsela.
