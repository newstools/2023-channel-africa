He was taking school students from the capital, Lilongwe, to the northern city of Mzuzu on Monday. The country's schools re-opened on Tuesday (except in Lilongwe and Blantyre) following the festive break. Marymount Secondary School, a girls' boarding school owned by the Catholic Church, hired a private bus to transport students ahead of the re-opening. The accident happened after the driver lost control of the bus, which was carrying 58 students, due to speeding, according to the police. A 14-year-old girl was pronounced dead on arrival at a nearby district hospital, while another, aged 12, had her left arm amputated. Police say the bus driver will be prosecuted, but did not say on what charges. --BBC--
