Police said the vehicle has been reported to have been involved in a house robbery earlier in the day and was spotted by officers on patrol along a road in Umbilo. “With the suspects defying police’s instruction to stop, a high speed chase ensued,” the police said in a statement. They said the vehicle collided head-on with a horse and trailer after driving into the oncoming traffic. The driver died at the scene while the injured were taken to hospital. --BBC--
