The worst-hit area is in Zambezia province, where 18 people have died after being hit by lightning and 15 others have been injured in the last two months. The National Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Agency is promoting an education campaign on the measures to take to avoid more fatalities. Safety measures recommended by the United Kingdom's Met OfficeÂ include: If outside, avoid water and find a low-lying, open place that is a safe distance from trees, poles or metal objects;
Be aware of metal objects that can conduct or attract lightning;
If you find yourself in an exposed location it may be advisable to squat close to the ground, with hands on knees and with head tucked between them.
