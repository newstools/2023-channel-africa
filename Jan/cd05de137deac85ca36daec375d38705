The original sentence, which came last year, against Edouard Bamporiki was a rare case of a top official convicted over corruption in the country. He was suspended from cabinet last May and put under house arrest while being investigated for corruption and misuse of power. He remained under house arrest until this ruling. Bamporiki confessed to the charges on Twitter and asked President Paul Kagame for forgiveness, but in September a court sentenced him to four years, which he appealed. This Monday, a high court judge in the capital, Kigali, said “justice needs to be served to set an example”. The 39-year-old poet and filmmaker was previously a vigorous supporter of Kagame and the ruling party and rose rapidly through the ranks. His lawyer, Evode Kayitana, told the BBC that they had not decided on whether to appeal. --BBC--
