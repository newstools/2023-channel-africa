It came after the United States (US) embassy warned of a possible terror attack in Tanzania's main city Dar es Salaam on January 25. Foreign Minister Stergomena Tax asked the foreign diplomats to "observe diplomatic communication channels as stipulated by the Vienna Convention... to avoid creating unnecessary tension within and without the country". She said Tanzania would "remain to be a peaceful, secure and stable country that gives due attention to matters of security internally, regionally and internationally". Two days after the US warned that areas in Dar es Salaam frequented by Westerners "continue to be attractive targets to terrorists planning to conduct attacks", Dutch airline KLM sent an alert to its customers regarding possible disruptions to its Tanzania flights due to “civil unrest”. --BBC--
