Regarding the war in Ukraine, the Eritrean President said "the illusion to generate a global uni-polar system has totally failed". He called for "an integrated effort to resist and combat the hegemonic and colonial history that had put the world into jeopardy". Eritrean Minister of Information, Yemane Gebremeskel, said the talks were on the "the dynamics of the war in Ukraine" and enhancement of ties between the two countries. "The discussions centred on the dynamics of the war in Ukraine and enhancement of bilateral ties on sectors of energy, mining, information technology, education and health," Yemane posted on Twitter. Eritrea was the only African country to vote against a United Nations resolution in March 2022 condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Lavrov arrived in Eritrea on the last leg of a second Africa tour in six months that also took him to Angola, South Africa and Eswatini. --BBC--
