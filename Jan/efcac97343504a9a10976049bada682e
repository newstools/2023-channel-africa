The crisis-hit nation becomes the fourth country to apply to the G20 initiative, launched in 2020 and designed to streamline debt restructuring efforts in the wake of poorer countries buckling under the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The West African country was pushing bilateral creditors to form a committee as soon as possible, aiming for an "expedited treatment,"Â  said a second source, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. The request came as part of a virtual presentation by Ghana's Finance Ministry, hosted under the auspices of the group of creditor nations known as the Paris Club, the source added. Ghana's debt restructuring under the common framework aims to include non-Paris Club members, such as China, in debt relief talks. China is Ghana's biggest bilateral creditor with $1.7 billion of debt, while the country owes $1.9 billion to Paris Club members, according to data from the International Institute of Finance. The Paris Club declined to comment. Ghana's Finance Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. --Reuters--
