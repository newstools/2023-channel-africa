The Catholic Archbishop of Juba, Stephen Ameyu Martin, said that plans for the pontiff to visit a camp for people displaced by conflict had been dropped. â€œCertainly, with the health of the Holy Father Pope Francis, it is not easy for him to go to the Internally Displaced People camp that we have here in Juba," he added. Instead, at least 2 000 of them would be invited to meet the pontiff at the city's Freedom Hall. Since May last year, the Pope, leader of more than a billion Catholics worldwide, has walked with the aid of a stick, or used a wheelchair. He will be visiting the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan between January 31 and February 5. --BBC--
