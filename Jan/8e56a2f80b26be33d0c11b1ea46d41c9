A local official is quoted as saying that the boat had been overloaded with passengers "beyond its capacity." The boat had been carrying passengers returning from a farm on the River Niger and broke in half as it approached Samanaji village in Koko-Besse district. Over 80 passengers were rescued. Boat accidents are relatively common in Nigeria, with many being blamed on overloading or poor safety measures. --BBC--
