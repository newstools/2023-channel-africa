Karebe gold mining company said in a statement late Monday that a wall built to prevent flooding and illegal incursion was blasted by illegal miners, causing an explosion. Three other workers were injured and hospitalised for treatment. Their conditions were not immediately available. Mine blasts are unusual in Kenya. Karebe said it had been reaching out to local government officials since 2021 to intervene and stop illegal miners from encroaching in its licensed area. The company said an official had visited the area this Monday and instructed illegal miners to stop their activities. --AP--
