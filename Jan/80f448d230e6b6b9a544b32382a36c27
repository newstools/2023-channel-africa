Struggling State power utility, Eskom, extended the country's worst-ever power cuts this Wednesday as more of its generating units broke down. Power outages are a major source of public frustration with the governing African National Congress party and a brake on economic growth in Africa's most industrialised nation. "We want to resolve the Eskom issue soon, part of that is to make sure (it has) a healthy balance sheet," Godongwana said during a meeting with the country's delegation to the World Economic Forum that kicks off in Davos next week. The Minister said an "appropriate announcement" on Eskom would be made on February 22. SA's annual budget is normally presented in February, and Godongwana is expected to unveil a plan for the government to take on part of the utility's roughly $23.59 billion debt.  --Reuters--
