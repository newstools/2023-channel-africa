From Tuesday, Morocco has banned travellers from China regardless of their nationality until further notice. The Foreign Ministry says the move is aimed at preventing a spike in infections in the country. Ghanaâ€™s restrictions will take effect on Friday. The moves come after China abruptly dropped its COVID-19 controls in December last year. Other countries outside Africa have also imposed restrictions. For example, passengers arriving in England from China now have to provide a negative COVID test before they board a flight. The United States is testing people on arrival. Countries that plan to test travellers say the policy will help spot worrying new variants early and prevent an influx of cases. Ghana says passengers from China will be tested at the airport for free and must also present a negative test result 48 hours before arrival. International health experts have argued that the lifting of restrictions in China has led to COVID-19 spreading much faster. But Beijing's Foreign Ministry has said coronavirus rules should only be introduced on a "scientific" basis and accused Western countries and media of "hyping up" the situation. --BBC--
