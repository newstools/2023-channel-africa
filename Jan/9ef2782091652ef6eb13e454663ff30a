Ahmed added that the ministry planned to bring its key debt service-to-revenue ratio down sharply this year and would not borrow on the international capital markets. Nigeria's government spent 80% of its revenue on debt servicing last year, a ratio that could rise to around 100%, the International Monetary Fund estimates. "Eighty percent is not sustainable, and our plan is that it is coming down to 60% in 2023," Ahmed said in a Bloomberg Television interview, adding that the country expected to produce 1.6 million barrels of oil a day this year.  --Reuters--
