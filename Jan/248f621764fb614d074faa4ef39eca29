Massano said the National Bank of Angola (BNA) decided to cut the interest rate by 150 basis points after inflation last month came in below the central bank's forecast. The Southern African country's inflation rate eased in December to 13.86% year on year from 15.24% in November. The central bank Governor said he expected Angola to end this year with inflation of 9%-11%. He also predicted 3.3% growth in gross domestic product for 2023. The BNA last cut its benchmark interest rate on September 26, when it lowered it to 19.5% from 20.0%, where it had been since July 2021. --Reuters--
