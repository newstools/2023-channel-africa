Such gatherings were banned by the former President, John Magafuli, in 2016. ButÂ the ban was lifted by his successor, Samia Suluhu Hassan, two weeks ago. Her decision is part of her "4 R's" initiative: - Reconciliation, Resilience, Reforms and Rebuilding. She acknowledged parties had the right to hold rallies, but she urged them to be "civil" and not to "trade insults" Since Magafuli's death in 2021,Samia has introduced limited reforms. She lifted a ban on pregnant girls attending school and oversaw a COVID vaccination campaign. She has now declared that freedom of political expression is a universal right.  --BBC--
