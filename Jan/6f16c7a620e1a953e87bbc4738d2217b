That’s the word from the Head of Genomics sequencing at Stellenbosch University, Professor Tulio de Oliveira. On Saturday, the XBB.1.5 was detected by the University’s Network for Genomics Surveillance. The Health Department says that they’re currently in discussions with scientists to gather more information about the variant, including its transmissibility and severity.

Professor de Oliveira has urged South Africans to get immunised with booster vaccines. "It is not a new variant of concern. It is part of the Omicron family of lineages, which now compares hundreds of different lineages. It is still omicron and emerged towards the end of last year, on the east coast of the United States, more especially in New York. We are alerted but not concerned. We will continue to do Genomics Surveillance." According to the World Health Organisation, symptoms of this sub-variant are similar to those of previous Omicron strains, where most people experience flu-like symptoms. XBB.1.5 is currently the dominant strain in the US and has been detected in at least 28 other countries. The SA Department of Health has again appealed to people to vaccinate, get boosters and observe non pharmaceutical interventions. --SABC--
