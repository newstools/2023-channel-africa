The victims who died were nine men and five women, while more than 70 were injured and were taken to hospitals. One of the buses was carrying mourners, including foreigners, heading to the funeral of a woman who had died in Europe, the Ivorian press agency reported. The exact cause of the accident has not been established. In a statement posted on Facebook, the Ivorian Transport Minister expressed condolences to the families of the deceased. The Ministry also called on motorists and road users to be more vigilant to avoid such accidents. Deadly road accidents are common in the West African country amid poorly maintained roads and vehicles. Driver errors also often contribute to the accidents.  --BBC--
