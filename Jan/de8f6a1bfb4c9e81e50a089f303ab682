The move is part of Eni's broader strategy to extract value from its diverse range of businesses by spinning off specific activities and growing them as independent entities. The group did not specify whether it would consider a listing or a partnership to develop the new company in the future. Since 2021, the group has set up Plenitude, which focuses on renewable energies, and Azule Energy, a joint-venture with BP dedicated to oil and gas activities in Angola. Last year the Italian group successfully listed its Norwegian oil and gas spin-off, Vaar Energy. Eni Sustainable Mobility is directly controlled by Eni, which holds 100% of its share capital, the group said. "Through this operation, we will integrate and unlock new value from our industrial initiatives, products, and services based on innovative technologies that will form a unique and decarbonised mobility offering," Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi said in a statement. Eni Sustainable Mobility will be the second lever supporting the group's energy transition strategy, together with Plenitude, Descalzi added. Last year, Eni postponed its plan to list Plenitude on Milan bourse due to market volatility, but the initial public offering could be revived or the group could consider a partnership with an investor, two sources told Reuters. Eni Sustainable Mobility incorporates existing bio-refining and biomethane assets, including the Venice and Gela bio-refineries, and will oversee the development of new projects, including those at Livorno and Pengerang in Malaysia. The company will also incorporate a network of over 5,000 sales points in Europe to market and distribute a number of energy carriers, among them hydrogen and electricity, as well as fuels of organic origin. Eni's Italian car sharing service, Enjoy, will also be part of the new venture. Stefano Ballista, former Sustainable Mobility Director at Eni Energy Evolution, is the Chief Eexecutive Officer of Eni Sustainable Mobility. --Reuters--
