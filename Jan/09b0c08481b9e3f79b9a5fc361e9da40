With political parties boycotting the vote, most candidates are independents and attention is likely to focus on whether there will be higher participation than there was in December. However, the electoral commission may use two separate metrics for turnout in the second round and will use Sunday's figure as the overall one for both rounds of the election, moves the opposition says are aimed at inflating the figures. "I'm not interested in elections that do not concern me," said Nejib Sahli, 40, passing a polling station in the Hay Ettahrir district of Tunis shortly before voting was due to begin. Inside the polling station, a Reuters journalist said no voters had appeared during the 20 minutes he spent there after polls officially opened. President Kais Saied has decreed the new, mostly powerless, parliament as part of a reconfigured presidential system that he introduced after shutting down the previous parliament in 2021 and assuming broad control over the state. Saied's critics accuse him of seeking to dismantle the democratic system enacted after Tunisia's 2011 revolution, which sparked the Arab Spring, and they ridiculed December's ultra-low turnout as evidence that his changes lack popular support. At a cafe in Ettahrir only Mongi Layouni, one of seven men sitting drinking coffee, said he might vote. "I don't know. Maybe I will go later," he said. Another man sitting in the cafe, who gave his name only as Imad, said he did not believe his vote mattered after Saied's political changes. "The President alone is deciding everything," he said. "He does not care about anybody, and we do not care about him and his elections." --Reuters--
