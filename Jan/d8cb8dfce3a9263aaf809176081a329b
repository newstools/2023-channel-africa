Nigeria is trying to overturn an award to Process & Industrial Developments (P&ID) of billions of dollars in damages that was made by a London arbitration tribunal in 2017. The West African oil and gas producing nation was found in 2015 to be in breach of a 20-year gas processing contract awarded to P&ID. Two years later, P&ID was awarded $6.6 billion for lost profits, a sum which has since swelled with interest to just over $11 billion, which represents around 30% of Nigeria's foreign exchange reserves. An eight-week trial began in London on Monday. The high-stakes case has attracted considerable interest among Nigerians. --Reuters--
