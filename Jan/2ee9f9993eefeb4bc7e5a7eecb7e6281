Alieu Badara Joof had only been in office for nine months. President Adama Barrow paid tribute to his late deputy, describing him as a "dedicated and committed" public servant who "touched the lives of many Gambians". An elaborate military ceremony has been planned to receive Joof's body before it is taken to a mortuary in the capital, Banjul. The body will lie in state on Monday before the funeral later that day, the government announced. --BBC--
