Homosexual acts are already illegal in Uganda. The President termed gay rights as "nonsense" during remarks made on Wednesday, at a graduation ceremony at the National Defence College. He added that he was glad to have attended a recent meeting in the United States, where issues of gay rights were not brought up. “Don't bring any more nonsense here... We were in Washington, and this time the Americans organised the meeting well because they did not bring up these issues. “They concentrated on business, which was good. They did not bring up issues about homosexuality. But if they would have brought those we would have had problems." Don't bring any more nonsense here...
