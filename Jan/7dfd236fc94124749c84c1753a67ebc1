Somalia now increasingly sees more drone strikes as crucial to finish off al Shabaab hide-outs, upending a policy Mogadishu fronted in the final months of the previous administration following mounting criticism of civilian casualties. When the United States (US) Africa Command announced on December 18 that it had killed 15 key leaders of al Shabaab in a drone strike, at the "request of the Federal Government of Somalia," Mogadishu released images of the dead Shabaab leaders to the public. The two strikes were labelled as "self-defence" measures to protect land forces pursuing al Shabaab and the government in Mogadishu said in fact that as many as 88 Shabaabs had been neutralised from their hideout in Adale, some 220km northeast of Mogadishu. This celebration, including the publication of images, was rare in the government of Mohamed Farmaajo. But his successor, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, has indicated he will use every available tool to eliminate the terror group. Since he came on in May, President Mohamud has encouraged the Somali National Forces and allied regional forces to target one enemy, a rare show of unity between the federal government and the security agencies in the federal states. He has also directed the media to stop covering the al Shabaab side of the story, accusing the terror group of damaging the name of good youth. And when local vigilantes took up arms to support the SNA forces, Mohamud cheered them on. The biggest of them is the call for more drone strikes. In an interview with Marc Lamont Hill of Upfront on Al-Jazeera earlier in December, he said he wants to loosen military restrictions on drone strikes use to gain a strategic advantage over terror groups. "How many drone strikes were successful without civilian casualties. We are doing everything we can to avoid civilian casualties and for the last six months that these operations are going on, we have succeeded in that." --TheEastAfrican--
