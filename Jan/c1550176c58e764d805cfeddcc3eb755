"He should be stripped of his accreditation," Ambassador Vasyl Myroshnychenko told AFP. Myroshnychenko also called on Djokovic, who is preparing to face Tommy Paul in the semi-finals of the tournament, to personally apologise and to clarify his stance on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. "He should apologise for what has happened, and condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine," he demanded. A video posted to a pro-Russian Australian YouTube account on Thursday showed Djokovic's father Srdjan posing with a man holding a Russian flag with Vladimir Putin's face on it. The video was captioned: "Novak Djokovic's father makes bold political statement." Serbian tennis reporters confirmed it was Djokovic's father and the Melbourne Age newspaper reported that he said in Serbian: "Long live Russia." Another man was photographed by AFP inside the stadium during Djokovic's match with a T-shirt bearing the Russian pro-war "Z" symbol. Last year, Djokovic was deported from Australia for refusing to be vaccinated against Covid-19, the controversy overshadowing the start of the tournament. Myroshnychenko said the player's response to the latest controversy would again draw attention away from what was happening on the court. Russia's embassy in Australia had hit back at the ban, calling it "another example of unacceptable politicisation of sports". Simeon Boikov, who runs the YouTube channel that posted the flag footage, urged Russian supporters to descend on Melbourne Park ahead of Djokovic's quarter-final match against Andrey Rublev. --AFP--
