Rumangabo Camp, north of the city of Goma, was seized last October but was handed over as part of a ceasefire brokered by East African leaders. However, M23 fighters have still been seen in the Kibumba area, despite the fact that it was also meant to have been handed over last month. At least 400 000 people were displaced last year during an offensive by the group. The DRC government and United Nations experts say Rwanda is supporting M23, which Kigali denies. --BBC--
