The report was compiled by the United States Agency for International Development and its research partners and is aimed at providing evidence on the nature and magnitude of human trafficking in SA to policymakers. Dr. Marcel van der Watt, a research fellow at the Free State Centre for Human Rights, says, "There are often preconceived ideas; so, in terms of the profile of perpetrators, we’ve got multiple nationalities involved in trafficking in SA, but South African nationals still eclipses all the nationalities in terms of perpetrators." "Gender is very interesting in successfully prosecuted cases: 38 women being convicted of trafficking, 39 men, so that’s very interesting when you look at male and female and the role that women have to also perpetrate and enable these criminal networks. We’ve got victims of trafficking from several African countries."  --SABC--
