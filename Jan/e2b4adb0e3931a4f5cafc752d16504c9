This would allow the country to avoid a food shortfall this year if the forecast rains failed in some areas of the country. They are also urging the government to prioritise food production this time around for fear of poor harvests in the 2022–23 season. "As we usher in the New Year, our biggest challenge is unfavourable weather," said Didi Kidawa, a resident of Arumeru District in Arusha. He told The Citizen that the recent rains in the northern regions were insufficient to entice farmers to return to their farms. "Without enough rain, there is a chance that this year may see a food shortage, which will have an effect on the economy," he pointed out. His remarks were echoed by farmers in Hanang District, Manyara Region, once considered the zone’s breadbasket for cereal production. "I am in my farm now cultivating. We had some rains recently, but to our shock, it had stopped," said Gilloya Mwammwaya, from Mogitu village. He added in the affirmative when reached on the phone: "We need rain for our livelihood. We have had enough dry spells last year (2022)." The Tanzania Meteorology Agency recently warned that this season’s rains will be below average in some parts of the country, notably the northern regions. --TheCitizen--
