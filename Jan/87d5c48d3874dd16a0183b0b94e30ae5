According to authorities, in one of the accidents, the truck, carrying a 12-meter-long (39-feet-long) container, was traveling on a bridge when the driver lost control and collided with the bus while it was picking up passengers. The container fell onto the bus, crushing those on board. Five men, two women, and two children were among the dead. The Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) said it rescued four people after hours of operations at Ojuelegba in the southwestern part of the state. The Secretary of LASTMA, Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, said, "We've completed the operations. We have put the dead bodies in the mortuary, and the other one that was rescued has been evacuated to the hospital, where she's receiving adequate treatment. â€œWe're going to look at it holistically; we're going to carry out investigations." Oke-Osanyintolu said overhead barricades mounted by authorities at the foot of the bridge to prevent trucks from ascending the span had been removed. He said the police will further investigate the matter.  --AllAfrica--
