M23 rebels have captured swathes of territory in mineral-rich North Kivu province since last year, advancing towards its capital, Goma. Police and local officials confirmed that the Tutsi-led group had cut off the road between Kitchanga and Goma. The main highway leading north out of Goma has been cut off since an earlier M23 advance. The fresh clashes come after the M23 was required to withdraw from territory it occupies, under the terms of regional mediation efforts. East African mediators have warned that the situation is deteriorating sharply. --BBC--
