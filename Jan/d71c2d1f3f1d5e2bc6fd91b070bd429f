Seifeddine Makhlouf, Head of the Islamist nationalist party al-Karama, was found guilty of insulting police during a protest at Tunis Airport in 2021. A court had initially sentenced him to five months in prison. Makhlouf has been a strident critic of President Kais Saied, who has been widely accused of mounting a coup. Eighteen months ago he froze Parliament before taking control of the judiciary and pushing through a new constitution that gave his office almost unlimited powers. --BBC--
