The country’s President, Cyril Ramaphosa, on Monday said the governing African National Congress (ANC) party had recommended that a national state of disaster be declared to ensure sufficient resources were allocated to alleviate the problem. This would be similar to the state of disaster declared in 2020 to manage the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, he said in his closing remarks at an ANC strategy meeting. “Work is already underway within government to establish whether the legal requirements of a national state of disaster are met and what specific actions we would be empowered to undertake,” Ramaphosa said. “A national state of disaster will enable us to have the instruments necessary to fully implement the challenges that our nation faces,” Ramaphosa added. South Africa has been grappling with an energy crisis for years and is currently experiencing lengthy power cuts blamed on ageing infrastructure and corruption. The ruling party has been under increasing pressure to resolve the crisis. Ramaphosa said the issue would receive urgent attention and be discussed fully at the government level. --BBC-- The strange move by @MYANC to declare SA's energy crisis a 'National State of Disaster':1. Presents SA govt as sleeping on duty, requiring a declaration of National State of Disaster to wake up.2. Paints SA as a failed state, with no scientific response to its energy crisis! https://t.co/BKyNn1tHog Declaring the State of Disaster on Electricity Supply was the No 1 recommendation at the 27 January Black Business Council Energy Indaba ⁦@BlackBCouncil⁩ pic.twitter.com/WIFhb7JHwc If Cyril declares a state of energy disaster:1. What is he gonna differently that he hasn't done so far?2. State of disaster exists as long as the disaster persists. How long is this proposed state of disaster going to last?3. How much are they going to steal this time?
