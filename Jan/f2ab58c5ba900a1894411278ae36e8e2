A warrant of arrest has been issued against him and other close associates by the regional magistrate in Broadhurst, Botswana. Speaking exclusively to SABC, the former head of State says if law enforcement agencies in his country evoke the extradition treaty that binds South Africa and Botswana, the matter will have to be ventilated in a foreign court. Khama says he will expose those behind his current challenges. "That is something that I will welcome. It will assist me to divulge to reveal, to expose in a foreign court what has been going on in Botswana. So all the evidence they think they have against me I will also have the evidence to show that it is all fabricated and trumped up. So for me, it will be a wonderful opportunity to be able to show everybody in this country, everywhere else exactly what has been going on." --SABC--
