The SA team were brave but suffered a narrow 49-42 loss to the England Roses in a pulsating match in front of a packed arena. The two teams played to a 46-all draw on day two of the tournament. The third ranked England Roses were on the ascendancy early in the match to race to a 9-3 lead. But the fifth-ranked SA team showed fighting spirit to level 12-all after the first quarter with goal shooters Nicole Taljaard and Lenize Potgieter on song. In the second quarter, the Roses started brightly to take a 16-13 lead, but just like in the first quarter, the SA team clawed their way back to level 23-all before the Roses pulled away to lead 25-23 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Roses were always in front, but the SA team did well to stay in touch and trail by just two goals (36-34) going into the final quarter. The Roses continued with their dominance in the last quarter, but the home team refused to lie down, and England eventually secured a 49-42 victory. SA drew one and lost three matches in a series. The gallant display bodes well for the SA team's hopes of winning a bronze medal at the forthcoming World Cup in July at the same venue.  --BBC--
