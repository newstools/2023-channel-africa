Decades of instability in the east of the country have forced scores of refugees across the border into Rwanda. "This is not Rwanda's problem," said Kagame, adding: "I am refusing that Rwanda should carry this burden." He said the rest of the world had completely missed the point when it came to eastern DRC. The real threat to security, in his view, is what he describes as the remnants of Hutu extremist forces who tried to wipe out his Tutsi ethnic group in the 1994 genocide. Rwanda is being accused of backing the M23 rebel group, which the country has always denied. The rebel group has captured swathes of territory in recent months, sending tens of thousands of refugees across the border into Rwanda. --BBC-- “We have had refugees here for over 20 years, from DRC. I am refusing that Rwanda should carry this burden and be insulted and abused everyday about it.” President Kagame. pic.twitter.com/laDAQrW05d Mr président don’t use refugees in your war with DRC those people have the right to stay in Rwanda as refugees, as Congo still has millions of hutu refugees who don’t wana go back to Rwanda , so if you are angry use other means to international community not refugees
