Abdalle Mumin was arrested in October after saying that the directive could be used to target government critics. Somalia launched a large-scale offensive last year against the militant group and appears to be having the upper hand. Lawyers representing the journalist asked the court to summon high-ranking government officials linked to his arrest last October. Mumin, who is the Secretary-General of the Somali Journalists Syndicate, is facing incitement charges for criticising a government ban on reports about al-Shabab. The case was adjourned to an unspecified date next week. Since issuing the directive, Somali authorities have shut down hundreds of outlets affiliated with al-Shabab and ordered the media to refer to the group as “khawarij”, meaning ultra-extremists. Mumin’s court case has underscored continued risks journalists in Somalia face while reporting on the al-Shabab insurgency or agitating for press freedoms. --BBC--
