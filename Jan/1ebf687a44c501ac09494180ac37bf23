A Spokesperson for the Congolese government said the remarks by Rwanda's President Paul Kagame proved that human rights were of no value to him. He accused Kigali of blackmailing the international community by using refugees for political purposes. Patrick Muyaya said even though Kagame had attempted to walk back on his remarks on the subject, he had "revealed his true intentions". More than 70 000 Congolese have crossed to Rwanda, fleeing a conflict between the government and the M23 rebels, which the international community says is supported by Rwanda. Kigali denies the claim. Eastern Congo is scarred by dozens of conflicts, mostly over mineral resources. --BBC--
