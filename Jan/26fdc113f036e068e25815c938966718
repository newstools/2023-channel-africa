"I had my bags packed and my flights booked back to the US," Mmoh said in his on-court interview. "Life is crazy. When you think everything is looking dark, there's light at the end of the tunnel." Mmoh, ranked No 107, will play compatriot J.J. Wolf next. Wolf overhauled Frenchman Laurent Lokoli (4-6, 2-6, 7-6 (7), 6-4, 6-2) in the previous round. Zverev, ranked No 13 and back from injury, defeated Peruvian lucky loser Juan Pablo Varillas (4-6, 6-1, 5-7, 7-6 (3), 6-4) in his opening match. Despite taking the first set on a tie-break, the German was clawed back by his inspired opponent. “I could have easily been in the States right now, I was ready to go. So the fact that I’m still here playing in front of you guys, it’s insane. “This is the biggest win of my career hands down. Coming out, I definitely felt the nerves a little bit, but I felt like I settled down at the end of the first, and at that point, I told myself I shouldn’t even be here to be honest, I’m lucky to be at this point. “The last thing I wanted to do was not go for it when I had the chance and that’s what I told myself on the match point, if I get a ball, just go for it, you’re not even supposed to be here.” The 25-year old was born in Saudi Arabia, where he lived until the age of 13. He is of Irish and Nigerian ancestry. His father Tony Mmoh was also a professional tennis player who represented Nigeria and reached a career-high ranking of 105. --Reuters\ChannelAfrica--
