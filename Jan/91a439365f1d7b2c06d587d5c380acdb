Dwight Sagaray, who was the Venezuelan embassy's first secretary, was found guilty of the killing of Olga Fonseca on July 27. 2012. Three Kenyan nationals who had been charged alongside Sagaray were also convicted. The diplomat was tried for the murder after his diplomatic immunity was waived by Venezuela. Fonseca, 57, was killed less than two weeks after she started her new role in Nairobi on July 15. The motive for her killing is unclear, but Kenyan officials said at the time that some staff at the residency were unhappy after being sacked by Fonseca. -BBC-
