Maseko was sitting in his living room at home with his family on Sunday in the town of Luyengo when gunmen shot him through a window. "Thulani Maseko was a stalwart of human rights who, at great risk to himself, spoke up for many who couldnâ€™t speak up for themselves," Turk said in a statement. "The Eswatini authorities must also ensure the safety and security of all eSwatini people, including human rights defenders, journalists and political activists, and to protect civic space." --BBC--
