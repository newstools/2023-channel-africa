Those behind the study blame misinformation as some sex workers, who are on a daily HIV prevention pill, believe it will also prevent them from sexually transmitted diseases and were not able to negotiate condom use. More than 350 sex workers from one clinic in Nairobi, which reported high cases of gonorrhoea, took part in the study. Three-quarters of the participants admitted to having unprotected sex with their partners and clients, as it pays more. Some of them said they slept with at least 29 clients in two weeks. The researchers are calling on the Kenyan government to change the current treatment policy as well as advocate for more tests to determine how widespread the problem is in the country. Gonorrhoea is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases globally. More than 80 million cases are reported globally every year. What is gonorrhoea? --BBC--
