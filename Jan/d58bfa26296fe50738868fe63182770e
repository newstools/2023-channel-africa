The joint venture between Zambia’s state-owned power utility, Zesco and a UAE government-owned renewable energy company, Masdar, targets the development of 2 000 megawatts of solar power projects, President Hakainde Hichilema said in a statement on his Facebook page. “This is not a loan but a capital injection in which the Zambian people, through Zesco, will be partners in shareholding,” he said. Zambia, Africa’s second-biggest copper producer, has an installed electricity generation capacity of 3 500 megawatts. The country is currently suffering rolling blackouts lasting as long as 12 hours a day after water levels in the Kariba Dam, used by the nation and neighboring Zimbabwe to generate hydropower, declined drastically. --newzimbabwe.com--
