Making the announcement on Citizen television's JKLive show on Wednesday, Mutua said United States (US) First Lady Jill Biden will be visiting the country in February. "Next month, we will get high-profile leaders coming to our country. Biden will be here," he said. However, Mutua did not reveal the purpose of the visit. Mutua said at the moment Kenya is an attractive destination for foreign dignitaries owing to its democratic stance. He praised Kenya saying it provides an environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms. "Kenya's place is high right now. I was invited to the G7 as Kenya's Foreign Minister with other Ministers because of Kenya's place in the world and the role we are playing in the peace process because of the democracy that we have," Mutua said. President William Ruto was among the more than 50 African heads of state invited to the US-Africa Leaders Summit in December 2022. On the sidelines of the high-level meeting between US President Joe Biden and the continental leaders, Ruto held talks with various partners. "Among the deals, he secured our partnerships with World Bank on various economic projects in the country and on climate innovations and carbon removal," Mutua said. --The-star.co.ke--
