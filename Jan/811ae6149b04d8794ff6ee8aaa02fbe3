It says a joint operation was carried out with Somalia's international partners, which include the United States  (US) military. Over the last six months the al-Shabab group has lost swathes of territory as the result of an operation led by pro-government forces. It is impossible to independently verify the details of this attack but the Somali government has described what sounds like a significant setback for al-Shabab. The Information Minister said 136 jihadist fighters had been killed in a joint operation with Somalia's international partners. Just three days ago the US said it’s special forces had killed a senior militant leader during a raid in the north of the country. Several years ago Bilal al-Sudani split away from the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab and played a key role trying to boost the presence of the Islamic State group in other parts of the continent, including Mozambique and eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. --BBC--
