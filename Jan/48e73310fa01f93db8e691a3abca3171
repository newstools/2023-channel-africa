This is the highest figure the country has ever recorded for a cholera outbreak. There are fears that health officials are struggling to contain the outbreak as they are running low on medical supplies, including vaccines, most of which were used up last week. More than 30 000 infections have been reported in Malawi. Most cases and deaths have been recorded in the capital, Lilongwe, and in Blantyre, where the opening of schools was delayed to control the spread of cholera. The widespread cases are linked to the impact of climate change, that caused extensive flooding last year and destroyed the country's water and sanitation systems. The Health Minister, Khumbize Chiponda, has urged people to use safe water and observe basic hygiene, but very few people have access to safe water and improved sanitation facilities. Two weeks ago, the country launched an international appeal, asking for medical supplies to contain the outbreak. The Health Ministry has also asked the World Health Organisation to assist them in getting 7.6 million doses of cholera vaccines. However, with only two manufacturers producing this vaccine and a global cholera outbreak, it’s unlikely that they’ll get them any time soon.  --BBC--
