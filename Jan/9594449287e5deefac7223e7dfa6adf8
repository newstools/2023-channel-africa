Seven suspects, including two village chiefs, have also been arrested and are currently in police custody. Twenty people were kidnapped from the Igueben train station by armed men on January 7. Six victims were freed within 48 hours, and a further 12 victims were rescued by security services and armed vigilantes over the weekend in a separate rescue operation. Kidnapping for ransom is common across Nigerian roads, and there are concerns that criminals are starting to target the countryâ€™s railways.  --BBC--
