"I am here with my colleagues on our knees to beg Akufo-Addo, the headmaster, the education office, and our fellow Ghanaians. We are sorry for our videos that went viral. “We did not mean for it to go viral, it was a childish play. We are sorry and on our knees that the President should call us back," one of the students said in a video. The former students of Chiana Senior High School in the Upper East region were initially suspended before being expelled on Thursday by the Ghana Education Service (GES). GES described the students' actions as "very undesirable, and contrary to the acceptable standards of the conduct generally required of any student in Ghana’s educational system," according to local reports. An opposition Member of Parliament said the decision was harsh and retrogressive and asked Akufo-Addo to intervene, My JoyOnline news site reports.  --BBC--
