Residents of Edenvale community in the Gauteng province spotted the tiger roaming the area, local media reported. The National Council for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) was said to have confirmed the sighting of the animal. Authorities urged caution and asked residents to keep animals indoors. News outlet News24 later reported that the tiger had been recaptured, and was to be taken to a sanctuary. Earlier this month, a pet tiger escaped from a farm in Walkerville in Gauteng for days and attacked a man, a dog and a pig before it was shot dead.  --BBC--
