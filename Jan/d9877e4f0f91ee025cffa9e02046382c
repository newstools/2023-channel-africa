The Health Department has reiterated that it is not yet considering imposing restrictions following the detection of the new XBB 1.5 sub-variant in the country. The Stellenbosch University has described it as the most transmissible to date with symptoms close to that of Omicron. The XBB 1.5 variant, also nicknamed the Kraken, is currently prevalent in the US. De Oliveira says South Africa has high population immunity against COVID-19. "Early detection and preparation can make a big difference. One also has to be reminded that the United States is a bit like SA with high population immunity, which is very different from China," says De Oliveira. "So, we need to see what happens in the US to make sure that nothing or very little will happen in SA, as we are alert and it will not cause a big problem in the country." --SABC--
