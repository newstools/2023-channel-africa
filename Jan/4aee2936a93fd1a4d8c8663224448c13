The resident had this Monday shared a picture and video of her frightening experience on social media. A Spokesperson for the water utility firm, Johannesburg Water, said it suspects the water was contaminated by copper in the building, but samples had been taken for testing, according to local reports. The results are expected in 24 hours after the samples have been tested, Puleng Mopeli is quoted as saying. The affected resident told IOL news site that the blue water eventually stopped coming out. --BBC-- The little water coming out of our taps RN.
