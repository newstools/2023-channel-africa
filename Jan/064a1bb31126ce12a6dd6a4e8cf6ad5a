The Ministry lowered the local price for diesel to 628 Sudanese Pounds ($1.11) from 660 Pounds ($801,2) last month and lowered the gasoline price to 506 Pounds ($614,3) from 620 Pounds ($752,9).

A reduction in the prices of petrol and diesel, announced by Sudan's Ministry of Energy and Oil, will bring little relief to consumers, who face unprecedented high prices for basic food and commodities. Transport drivers say soaring maintenance costs will blunt any impact. Experts agree that the overall effect on the beleaguered Sudanese economy will be minimal, "as the fuel import market is monopolised by brokers and parasitism", and the price of fuel in Sudan is still above the world average.  --Reuters/AllAfrica--
