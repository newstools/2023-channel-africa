After Mali forced French troops out last year, neighbouring Burkina Faso followed suit this week, asking Paris to empty its garrison in the next month. France was already drawing down its troops across the Sahel region, who just a few years ago numbered more than 5 000, backed up with fighter jets, helicopters, and infantry fighting vehicles. Around 3 000 remain, but the forced departures from Mali and Burkina Faso as well as the Central African Republic to the south last year underline how anti-French winds are gathering force. "France is paying for its desire to maintain a very significant political and military presence in its former dominions," said Jean-Herve Jezequel, a Region Specialist from the International Crisis Group (ICG), a conflict-focused think tank. After the independence movement in the 1950s and 1960s, Paris still intervened regularly in the domestic affairs of its former colonies and for decades retained sway through business and political ties under an unofficial policy known as "Francafrique." Today, its influence has shrunk, and it faces growing competition from Russia, but its permanent military presence and the existence of common regional currencies underpinned by the French central bank are targets for populist politicians. "The idea that the former colonial power can retain such a strong military presence is hard to stomach for many people," Jezequel told AFP, adding that there remained a "post-colonial hangover that has not been resolved". Gilles Yabi, founder of the Senegal-based WATHI think-tank, told AFP there was a "desire from some sections of society to enter a new phase, to grasp a 'new independence'." --AllAfrica--
