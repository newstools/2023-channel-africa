The referee stopped the game in the second half because of the racist taunts, the AFP news agency reports. France international Umtiti was the primary target of the abuse. Lecce, who won 2-1, afterwards praised their fans for responding to the abuse by chanting Umtiti's name. "The racist chants were submerged by those of encouragement," the club said in a tweet. --BBC--
