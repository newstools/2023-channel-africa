Danjuma scored six goals in 17 matches in all competitions for Villarreal this season, taking his overall total for the LaLiga side to 22 goals in 51 games. The Nigerian-born 25-year-old has experience of playing in England, having been with Bournemouth for two years before he moved to Villarreal. Danjuma was first called up to the Netherlands national team in October 2018 and earned a recall last season. He currently has two goals in six international appearances. British media reported that relegation-threatened Everton were close to signing Danjuma before fifth-placed Tottenham roped him in. --Reuters--
