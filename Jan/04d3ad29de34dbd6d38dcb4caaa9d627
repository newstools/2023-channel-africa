Kristalina Georgieva is expected to attend a roundtable discussion on climate change financing with East African finance ministers and governors of central banks, the East African newspaper reports. She announced on Twitter that she was looking forward to "hearing local and regional perspectives on how the IMF can be even more helpful, especially in boosting climate resilience." Georgieva is visiting after the IMF, under a new facility, approved a $319 million (Â£258 million) fund for Rwanda, the first African state to get the fund to build climate change resilience. The Rwandan opposition has questioned the government's transparency in the use of international aid and loans. President Paul Kagame has recently said, however, that the government "efficiently uses every coin" of the aid from its partners. Georgieva arrived in Rwanda from Zambia.  --Reuters--
