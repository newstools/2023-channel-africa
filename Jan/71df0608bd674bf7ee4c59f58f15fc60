Known as a Permanent Voter's Card (PVC), it contains biometrical data of the voter and is used as further verification of identity on election day. This is the second time the deadline for collection of PVCs has been changed by the electoral commission. The date initially set by the Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) was Monday December 12, 2022, before being moved to Sunday January 29, 2023. The latest extension comes as many people have been finding it difficult to get their cards from collection centres, with some being told their cards have yet to be printed or cannot be found. Voting in presidential and parliamentary elections is due to take place on Saturday February 25, 2023. --BBC--
