The video shows two soldiers throwing a corpse on to the side of a bonfire of burning rubbish; one of them then throws liquid over the body and the flames spread. Another body is already on the pile of items, but has not yet caught alight. During the 20-second clip, a pot is also flung into the pile. Two men in army fatigues holding mobile phones appear to be filming the fire, one of them has the SA flag on his uniform. South African troops are part of the regional force, known as the Southern African Development Community Mission in Mozambique (Samim), helping to fight jihadists in northern Mozambique. In a statement, the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) said the commander of Samim was "conducting an investigation surrounding the involvement of its members in this despicable act. "The SANDF does not condone in anyway the acts committed in the video and those who are found guilty of such acts will be brought to book." The SANDF said the incident was believed to have taken place in November in Mozambique. The BBC's Jose Tembe reports from Mozambique's capital, Maputo, that the government has not yet commented on the video. Some people who have seen the footage have reacted with shock, saying those behind the "horrible" incident must be held responsible, he says. However, he reports that others said they doubted it had happened in Mozambique. --BBC--
