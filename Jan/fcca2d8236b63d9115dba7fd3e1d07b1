New Zealand crushed South Africa (SA) 61-41 in Cape Town Saturday, pulling away in the third quarter, where they outscored the Proteas 20-5. Netball fans in New Zealand and Australia missed a chunk of the first half after a source broadcasting issue in SA. Coverage was briefly lost in the first quarter and then there was another glitch late in the term. The broadcast did not return until halftime with those who had risen early to watch the game in New Zealand missing the entire second quarter. A Sky Spokesperson said they apologised for the outage, which was “due to an issue with the host broadcaster in SA”. “We’re sorry for the interruption to this morning’s broadcast of the Netball Quad Series match between the Silver Ferns and SA. Sky has since received a clean feed and we are currently running a full replay and will do so again on Sky Sport 2 at 9pm (NZ time). Silver Ferns put forth a clinical third quarter effort, where NZ outscored SA 20-5 to build a 20-goal advantage. The Quad Series is being contested at Cape Town’s International Convention Centre, the same venue the World Cup will be played at in late July-August. --Stuff--
