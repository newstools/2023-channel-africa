The heavy downpours left a trail of destruction in four local municipalities with two people reported to have gone missing in Cofimvaba this Saturday. Disaster management teams, emergency services and the police are still searching for more people who may have been swept away by the floods. Spokesperson for the Chris Hani District Municipality, Bulelwa Ganyaza says the bodies were recovered Saturday night. “So far, police has retrieved one body whilst the search continues for one other person, who is also believed to have been swept away in Qumanco river, Cofimvaba. The Disaster Management team also recovered a woman’s body from the Komani river in Owen street. The deceased’s identity is still unknown. Residents are encouraged to report missing persons with the police and also urged to avoid dangerous crossings until floodwaters subside.” The Co-operative Governance Department says disaster management teams are on high alert across the country amid the continuing heavy rains which have already resulted in large scale damage. Downpours are being experienced in parts of Kwazulu-Natal, Gauteng, the Free State, Mpumalanga and the Eastern Cape. More rains or thunderstorms are forecast this Sunday for these provinces. COGTA says the National Disaster Management Centre is in contact with provincial and local disaster management centres. It says the ground in many other areas is already saturated and people must be extra vigilant.
