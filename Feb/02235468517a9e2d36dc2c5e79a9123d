Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez and 12 members of his cabinet will meet their counterparts in Rabat to sign as many as 20 agreements to boost trade and investment, including credit lines of up to $873 million and bring the two countries closer together in areas beyond migration. Bilateral trade rose to $18.6 billion in 2022, making Spain Morocco's biggest trade partner. Madrid is seeking to turn the page on a testy relationship with Rabat that has sparked regular diplomatic crises, most recently the storming by 8 000 migrants of Spain's north African enclave of Ceuta in 2021 after Morocco relaxed border controls. The event was seen as a response to Madrid's decision to allow Brahim Ghali, leader of the Polisario Front rebel group, which seeks to establish an independent state in Western Sahara, to enter Spain for medical treatment without informing Rabat. Sanchez restored cordial relations with Rabat in March 2022 after he reversed former colonial master Spain's four-decade policy on the Western Sahara by backing Morocco's proposal to create an autonomous region. The about-turn drew the ire of Algeria, a Polisario Front ally, which suspended a 20-year friendship treaty with Spain and warned it could cut the flow of natural gas even as it forges closer gas ties with Italy. The disputes underscore Spain's dependence on Morocco to control migration by Moroccans and sub-Saharan Africans seeking to cross the European Union's southernmost border. Last June, Morocco gave a blunt demonstration of its key role on migration when its law enforcement quelled an attempted mass border crossing into Melilla, Spain's other North African enclave, in a move that left at least 23 people dead and scores injured.  --Reuters--
