Millions have been displaced and thousands killed as M23 rebels and government forces fight a protracted war in that region. Delivering his opening remarks as the chair of the African Union Peace and Security Council, Ramaphosa says the volatile situation has gone for too long and the situation is untenable.

"The eastern DRC continues to experience periodic cycles of conflict and violence. To see people booted, women and girls violated."  --SABC--
