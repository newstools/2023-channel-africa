In rare comments about the war, which began in November 2020, Â Isaias said the claims were part of a disinformation campaign by detractors of the peace deal reached between the government in Ethiopia and Tigrayan forces for a permanent ceasefire in the country's civil war. He also declined to answer questions regarding when Eritrean troops will fully leave the Tigray region or on a succession plan in his country. Rights groups allege Eritrean soldiers have committed atrocities in northern Ethiopia, which include killing unarmed civilians, raping women, and the widespread looting of public and private property. Isaias was speaking in Kenya following a bilateral meeting with his counterpart, William Ruto. Isaias took power after independence in 1993, but the country has never held a national election, with critics accusing him of jailing people opposed to his rule. --BBC--
