The two teams face off in the second semi-final of the International Cricket Council’s Women’s T20 World Cup at Newlands in Cape Town this Friday. A semi-final against England in a big event is all too familiar territory for SA’s women. However, in four attempts, the SA team are yet to get the formula right. This time however the Proteas have a 12th man in the Newlands faithful to help inspire them to secure a berth on Sunday’s final. Meanwhile, for another youngster from Cape Town, Friday’s semi-finals in Newlands will have special meaning. Grade 10 student Isabella Wright will have the honour of raising the national flag, along with about 50 other girls from a local school. Wright does not play much cricket, apart from a few back-yard games. Still, for a teenager going out there to support the Proteas in a home World Cup will be a priceless memory. Local organisers are expecting another record crowd for Friday’s match. The match gets underway at 15h00 CAT. --SABC--
