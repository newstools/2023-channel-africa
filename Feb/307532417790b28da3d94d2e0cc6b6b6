Millions have been displaced and thousands killed as M23 rebels and government forces fight a protracted war in that region. Delivering his opening remarks as the chair of the African Union Peace and Security Council, Ramaphosa said the volatile situation has continued for too long and the situation is untenable.

We cannot but be troubled by this humanitarian catastrophe that continues to unfold. We cannot but be horrified to see people being butchered, women and girls violated."  --SABC--
