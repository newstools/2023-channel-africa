Nigerians will vote on Saturday in what could be their most credible and close electoral contest since military rule ended nearly a quarter of a century ago – and the first in which a presidential candidate who is not from one of the two main parties stands a chance. There are three main presidential candidates: Bola Tinubu, Atiku Abubakar, and Peter Obi. Mbeki urged Nigeria’s political parties, candidates, and their supporters to play their parts in ensuring peaceful, transparent, and credible elections over the weekend. The meetings were aimed at getting information about the upcoming elections. The term of office of the current President Muhammadu Buhari is coming to an end. Nigerians will elect a new President. There are security concerns, particularly in Northern Nigeria where Boko Haram has killed many people. Law enforcement agencies and the military have warned against any violence. --SABC--
