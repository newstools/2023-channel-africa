The photo, taken before the Shooting Starsâ€™ home game on Sunday against Akwa United, went viral. The official, Auwal Mohammed, has also been suspended for a year from any activities relating to the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL). In a letter to the Shooting Stars from the Interim Management Committee, the body which manages the NPFL, it described the incident as "a despicable act" that had brought the game into disrepute. "You failed to control the conduct of your officials which resulted in Auwal Mohammed urinating on the playing pitch in the full glare of the general public," it said. --BBC--
