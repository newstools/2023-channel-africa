The source said the investigation had been opened by the prosecutor's office of Nanterre, near Paris. The Nanterre prosecutor's office said it did "not want to communicate on this ongoing investigation". Neither PSG nor Hakimi could immediately be reached for comment. Le Parisien, which first revealed the investigation, said a 24-year-old woman went to police over the weekend, and said she had been raped by Hakimi in his home near Paris on Saturday. Le Parisien said the young woman did not file a formal complaint but that the prosecutor's office decides to investigate. --Reuters--
