The Bank of Tanzania's (BoT) latest figures put the amount that the country earned from tourism receipts at almost the same level as the one that was attained before the global COVID-19 pandemic. Tanzania earned $2.526 billion from tourism receipts in 2019. During that year, a total of 1 527 230 tourists visited Tanzania, the BoT figures show. However, with travel restrictions towards the end of 2019 when the pandemic started and throughout the year 2020, travel receipts to Tanzania and the number of tourists who visited the country plunged to $1 billion and 616,490, respectively. But with the end of restrictions and some internal initiatives, the latest BoT figures put the amount in travel receipts attained in 2022 at $2.56 billion. This symbolizes that the amount attained in travel receipts was 1.4% more than what was registered prior to the pandemic. Similarly, the number of tourists who visited the country reached 1 454 920. This was only shy of 2019 numbers by a measly 4.7%. "The level of tourist arrivals is approaching the pre-pandemic level of 1 527 230 in 2019, reflecting recovery of the tourism sector," the BoT says in its Monthly Economic Review for January, 2023, which covers the entire 2022 calendar year.
