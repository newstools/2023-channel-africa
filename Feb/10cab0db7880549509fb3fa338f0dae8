"This is a good soul taken out of the community and taken out of the country," says Nana Kweku-Ajimai, Founder of Ghana project football club. "Christian Atsu’s good deeds is all out there for people to see. Helping the poor in their communities, in his own village, here in Accra, here in Ghana, and all over. Playing for the Black Stars (Ghana national team) and all the things he has done for the club. The motivation he has given people to want to become footballers. So Christian will be remembered for the rest of our lives. He is gone but he is with us in spirit." Kweku-Ajimai added. Atsu's Manager in Turkey, Murat Uzunmehmet, told DHA News Agency on Saturday that his body had been found under the rubble of luxury flats that crumbled in the Turkish southern province of Hatay. There were initial reports the former Chelsea and Newcastle player had been rescued a day after the quake, but these turned out to be false. "We have reached his lifeless body. His belongings are still being removed. His phone was also found," Uzunmehmet told DHA. Ghana's ministry of foreign affairs said it had "received the unfortunate news". "The elder brother and twin sister of Christian Atsu and an officer of the (Ghanaian) embassy were present at the site when the body was recovered," the ministry said in a statement. Ghana said it was working with the Turkish government to organise the transport of the body back to Atsu's home country for burial. Midfielder Atsu scored the last of his 33 career goals for Hatayspor in Turkey's Super Lig on February 5, hours before the quake struck. "There are no words to describe our sadness," tweeted his Turkish top-flight club. --AfricaNews--
