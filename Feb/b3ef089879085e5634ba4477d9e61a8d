The Proteas continue to improve and after narrowly losing to a powerful Netherlands outfit last night, will see a draw against the United States (US) as a step in the right direction. They are left with matches against Australia and New Zealand to try to secure a berth to the quarter-finals. Both Proteas and the USA were searching for their first win of the World Cup. The US opened the scoring in the second quarter through a field goal from Hannah Miller. The Americans, who had already endured losses to Australia and Austria, were targeting a victory against the Proteas. Abigail Burnett put the US further ahead at the start of the third quarter. Proteas, however, came into this tie off the back of a solid performance against the number two ranked Netherlands. They struck back in the third quarter when Tegan Fourie pounced after a poor clearance. The Proteas then drew level just a minute later, Jessica O’Connor’s effort snick through a napping US defense. Two-all was how it ended, with Proteas coming so close to registering their first win of the World Cup. --SABC--
