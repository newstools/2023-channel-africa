Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is also set to arrive in Sudan this Wednesday to discuss with officials issues of joint concern, investment and trade. His stop in Sudan is part of a regional tour that will take him to Iraq, Mauritania and Mali. Lavrov will meet with his Sudanese counterpart Ali Al-Sadiq to discuss bilateral, regional and international affairs. They will tackle means to increase trade and investment between their countries. Sadiq said Sudan welcomes Lavrov’s visit and is keen on bolstering bilateral relations with Russia, SUNA reported him as saying. He added that the Sudanese government is eager to see an end to the Russian-Ukrainian war and resolution of the conflict through political and diplomatic means. He remarked that the war had negatively impacted African economies and destabilised their food security due to the rising cost of goods. Sudan enjoys strong relations with Russia that were forged when ousted President Omar al-Bashir was in power. International media had reported that Lavrov’s visit aims to confront American policies in Africa, gain African support for Moscow in its war in Ukraine and prepare for the upcoming Russian-African summit set for July. --Aawsat.com--
