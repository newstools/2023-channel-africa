KRU Chairperson Oduor Gangla said the Union would commit to conducting the elections within the parameters that were given by the sports tribunal and adhering to the KRU constitution, as well as the Sports Act. The Tribunal made the ruling last Tuesday, saying the elections held in September were invalid. Aggrey Chabeda, former Chairperson of the Kenya Rugby Patron Society will chair the board. Chabeda is joined by Cup Clubs representative Sadik Makii, Auka Gecheo who represents Championship clubs, Faith Basiye, the representative for womenâ€™s rugby and Sarah Ochwada, the KRU Board representative. The by-elections will take place at the Annual General Meeting on March 24 in Nairobi, and will run parallel with the election of the Chairperson and four directors whose terms would have expired. --Francis Mutegi\ChannelAfrica--
