The Diary of a Wimpy Kid series are said to violate the countryâ€™s traditions, customs and cultures, according to the authorities. Education Minister Adolf Mkenda said the books endanger the quality of education for children. Schools using the books will face disciplinary and legal measures, including having their registration revoked, the authorities said. The banned books in the series include: Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Ugly Truth Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever. Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Third Wheel Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Old School Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Double Down Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Gateway. "This is the first list, after we checked and verified that these books violate traditions and customs. The content in them are not good for the upbringing of Tanzanians. The review is ongoing," said Mkenda. He urged parents to regularly check their children's bags to ensure they are not using the books. --BBC--
