"This decision falls within the framework of preserving the interests of the Algerian state and the interests of the national community in this country," State Television quoted the Foreign Ministry statement as saying. "The Algerian embassy in Kiev, which suspended its activities due to the deteriorating security situation in Ukraine, will be managed by the Charg√© d'Affaires." The embassy closed in March last year after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The decision to reopen the embassy will be effective "as soon as possible," the statement read. --Reuters--
