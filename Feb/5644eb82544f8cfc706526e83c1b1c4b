The rains have been brought on by the global La Ni√±a weather phenomenon, which occurs in the Pacific Ocean. Over the weekend in Gauteng province, officials opened several floodgates to ease pressure from the Vaal Dam, one of the largest in the province. This meant deliberately flooding some properties near the dam. Officials have said this is to prevent the massive dam from collapsing and endangering thousands of people. They have also advised people living near the Vaal River to consider moving to higher ground until the water subsides. --BBC--
