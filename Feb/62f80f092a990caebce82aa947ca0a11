John Williams Ntwali was killed last month when a speeding vehicle hit the motorcycle on which he was a passenger. The authorities said it was a traffic accident. Rights groups called for an independent investigation, describing his death as suspicious. Human Rights Watch said Ntwali had been regularly threatened and attacked in pro-government media for his investigative reporting. The trial was not open to the public but some journalists were invited to witness the reading of the verdict. --BBC--
