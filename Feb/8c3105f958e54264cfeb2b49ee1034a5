They will join eight cheetahs from neighbouring Namibia that were released into the Kuno National Park in central India last year. "The 12 cheetahs... have begun their journey to India," India's Environment Minister wrote on Twitter this Friday, adding they were expected to arrive Saturday. They were sedated and loaded into crates, and on their way to Johannesburg's OR Tambo International Airport, where they will be picked up by an Indian military aircraft. The cheetahs, seven males and five females, are the first of dozens that SA has promised India over the next decade. A subspecies similar but separate to the African cheetah, the fastest land animal on Earth, became extinct on the Indian subcontinent in 1952. --Reuters--
