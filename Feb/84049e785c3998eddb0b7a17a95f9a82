Food, consumer goods companies and retailers in SA are cranking up diesel generators and spending more on back up power supplies, adding to the pressure from soaring costs for raw materials, transportation, and packaging. South African businesses and households are spending between six and ten hours a day without electricity as state-owned utility Eskom implements some of the harshest blackouts in living memory owing to breakdowns at its coal-fired power plants. In an open letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa, the chief executives of member companies of the Consumer Goods Council of SA pleaded for urgent and decisive action from the government to solve the power crisis. "While we have maintained our operations and supply chains so far by using emergency power generators, this has been at an unsustainable financial cost," the council said in the letter, which was sent to local media. "It is crippling our businesses, and will, in the end, mean much higher prices for consumers, who are already under severe financial strain." Last year, Ramaphosa promised to expand generation, slash red tape and buy surplus electricity from private producers. He is expected to address the power crisis in his State of the Nation address on Thursday. 
The council, whose members include the country's biggest supermarket group and food producer Shoprite and Tiger Brands, said if the crisis continues, businesses will not be able to guarantee stable supplies of food, medicines, and other essential goods. Shoprite has said its additional spend on diesel to operate generators amounted to R560 million ($32 million) in the six months to January 1. Supermarket group Pick n Pay spent R346 million ($19.6 million) in the 10 months to December 25 to run generators, and is currently spending about R60 million ($3.3 million) per month. --Reuters--
