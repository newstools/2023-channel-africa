It's the last round of voter registration ahead of general elections scheduled for December this year. The Independent National Electoral Commission said voters will be registered in the volatile provinces of Ituri and North Kivu, as well as in the United States and Canada. Voter registration across the country started in December and has so far seen at least 12 million people register as voters, according to the commission. According to the United Nations, the violence in the eastern part of the country is estimated to have displaced some 5.6 million people who are in dire need of food and shelter.  --BBC--
