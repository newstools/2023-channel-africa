The presence of  representatives of the EU and envoys representing France, Germany, the US, and Norway, in Sudan, comes more than two months after political parties and top officials of the ruling military government signed a framework deal. The deal signed on December 5, last year, is aimed at paving the way for two years of civilian-led transition towards elections and end on-and-off violent standoff triggered by a military coup in October 2021. The deal sets the pace for the army to step down from politics. Be that as it may, it may be important to point out that  political parties are negotiating a new path to elections while the generals protect their interests and militant oppositionists take to the streets. The framework agreement that the parties signed has been officially endorsed by United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres. The framework agreement calls for the restoration of a civilian cabinet, a two-year transition once the prime minister is appointed and the review of important decisions, including the Juba Peace Agreement, and the appointment of dozens, if not hundreds, of high-ranking civil servants. -- JamesShimanyula, ChannelAfrica--
