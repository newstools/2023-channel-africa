The deaths were confirmed by the head of Olamze District Hospital, which is a short distance across the border in Cameroon. According to the Cameroonian health authorities, the victims contracted some form of haemorrhagic fever because their symptoms included nosebleeds, weakness, vomiting blood, fever, and diarrhoea. The cases of contagion and deaths are from three localities in northern Equatorial Guinea. Four of the victims came from the same family. Contamination occurs through direct contact with the infected person, according to the Cameroonian health authorities. They're telling Cameroonians to stay vigilant. The Equatoguinean authorities say Ki√©-Ntem will star under quarantine until the nature of the illness and the source of the outbreak are confirmed. --BBC--
