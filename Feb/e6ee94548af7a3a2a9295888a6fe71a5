The BBC had on February 10 reported about the dead fish washing up on Maputo Bay and causing concern for the authorities. Fisheries Minister Lidia Cardoso said this Wednesday the results revealed that the main cause had to do with the change in climatic conditions. She also dispelled rumours that the fish had died because of chemical poisoning. “It had nothing to do with chemical components. “The discharge from the rivers due to the floods affected the fish, which are very vulnerable to stress, and because the salinity level in the water dropped, the fish died,” she said. --BBC--
