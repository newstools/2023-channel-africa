The top global PGM producer's headline earnings per share (HEPS), the main profit measure in SA, fell to R185.42 ($10.25) in the year to December 31, 2022, down from R300.42 ($16,64) in 2021. The Johannesburg-listed firm also said PGM sales volumes declined 25% to 3.8 million ounces last year, from a record 5.1 million ounces in 2021. The record 2021 production performance was driven by an increase in refined output after the rebuild and recommissioning of the Anglo Converter Plant Phase A unit. The Polokwane smelter rebuild, which was due to be completed in October 2022, was delayed until December after the delivery of sub-standard materials, the company said. Amplats declared a total dividend of $6.37 per share, down from $16,62 per share last year, returning $1.66 billion to shareholders. --Reuters--
