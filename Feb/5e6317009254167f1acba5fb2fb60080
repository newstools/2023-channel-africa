Mbeki says this election in Nigeria will be Africa’s largest democratic exercise. He says the outcomes of the polls will be significant not only for Nigeria but also for the entire continent. Mbeki appealed to all role players to uphold their commitment to have peaceful elections. Some of the dominant issues in the hotly contested elections include insecurity, fighting corruption, economic growth, and dealing with kidnappings.
