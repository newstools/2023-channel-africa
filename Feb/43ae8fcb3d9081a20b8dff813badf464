This is according to a policy memo published by Global Financial Integrity (GFI) and its allies, indicating that if not addressed, TBML has adverse effects on economies and societies as it perpetuates criminal activities such as illicit wildlife trade, bribery, corruption, and tax evasion. Reacting on the report, the Director for Taxpayer Services and Education of Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) Richard Kayombo said: "I haven’t read the report, but such studies provides us with insightful analysis of the situation." "We’ve designed various measures to reduce or deter the said illicit trade. This includes and not limited to cooperating with law enforcers in curbing the matter," he added. On the other hand, the taxman does work closely with other customs and law enforcement administrations in the neighbouring countries in response to counter trade based money laundering, Kayombo added. Mr Kayombo conceded that the task isn’t easy. "The challenge is that it is a transboundary issue, and yet we have a vast coastline, about 1400 kilometre, plus three lakes (Victoria, Tanganyika and Nyasa) that border Tanzania with its neighbours," he added. This makes it hard to detect smuggling routes whereby goods and services associated with this kind of crime land, he noted. "However, a lot has been done, including the formation of an anti-smuggling task force, patrolling, and conducting awareness campaigns," he said. --TheCitizen--
