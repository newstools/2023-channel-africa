Cheneso, which made landfall on January 19, was Madagascar's first tropical storm of the year. The Indian Ocean island nation is typically hit by a series of such storms each year. The government's Office for Risk and Disaster Management said in a report released late Monday that nearly 37 000 people had been displaced by the storm, which caused flooding and landslides. The government had announced a death toll of 16 last week. At least 138 people were killed and about 130 000 were left without homes in January and February last year after four major storms hit Madagascar. --Reuters--
