It says more than seven million people continue to be affected by the country’s longest and most severe drought in decades. At an event in the capital, Mogadishu, the UN, the Somali government, and humanitarian agencies said the international response so far was insufficient. They've requested more than $2.5 million (£2 million). The drought has so far forced more than 1.4 million people from their homes and destroyed at least 3.5 million livestock. "Somalis have zero contribution to the climate change, but we are facing this dire consequence," the country’s special envoy for drought response said at the event. --BBC--
