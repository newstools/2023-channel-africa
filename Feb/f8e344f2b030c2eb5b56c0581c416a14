Some five other people sustained injuries during the protests on Wednesday, they added. The residents were angered by the worsening water shortage in the town and held a protest in front of the city’s water management office. "We have waited long to hold demonstrations. We came out today hoping we would get [solutions]. But things have turned into guns and blood," one resident told the BBC. The BBC’s attempts to speak to district officials have not been successful.  --BBC--
