Gachagua defended recent government appointments saying those who backed him and President William Ruto deserved to “reap first”. “This government is like a company guaranteed by shares. There are the owners of the company, there are those with many shares, those with few shares and those with none. "You invested in the government and now it’s time for you to reap,” he said. “There are those who criticise me for saying this but is that wrong? Even those critics and those who didn’t support us will reap, but they will have to wait for what remains so that people can know when they vote, it means something and has consequences.” But Kenyans on social media have criticised his remarks saying the government should serve all Kenyans regardless of who they voted for. They add that all citizens deserve equal attention from the government, including when it comes to development projects. --BBC--
