After a 10-day visit to the CAR, Yao Agbetse, who's Togolese, called on the government to investigate allegations of summary executions and disappearances levelled against the Russian mercenaries, particularly in Mambéré-Kadéï prefecture. The group is reported to be exploiting gold reserves there. Agbetse also said the Russians and the military were obstructing the UN mission in the country, something he called unacceptable. They have not yet commented on the allegations.  --BBC--
