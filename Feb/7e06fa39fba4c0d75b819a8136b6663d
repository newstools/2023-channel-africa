It comes just weeks after Russia promised more military support and training for countries across West Africa. Macron announced the new strategy ahead of a four-nation Africa visit as more global powers vie for influence on the continent. Macron described French military bases in Africa as a heritage from the past. French forces, who had been fighting against militants in the region for more than a decade, pulled out of Mali last year after the country invited in the Wagner group. Macron described the group as the life insurance of failing regimes. French troops were also asked to leave Burkina Faso in January amid a growing anti-France sentiment. Macron’s newly unveiled strategy is meant to redefine France’s relationship with Africa as competition from Russia and China grows. --BBC--
