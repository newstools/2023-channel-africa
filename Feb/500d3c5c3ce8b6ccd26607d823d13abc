Harare-born Ballance, who played 23 tests for England between 2014 and 2017, signed a two-year contract in December to play international cricket in the country of his birth. The left-handed batsman made his international debut for Zimbabwe in a T20 match against Ireland last month. With regular captain Sean Williams recovering from a fractured finger, Craig Ervine will lead Zimbabwe against West Indies. The hosts will also miss pacemen Tendai Chatara and Blessing Muzarabani through injuries, while all-rounders Sikandar Raza and Ryan Burl are fulfilling franchise commitments. The second test, also in Bulawayo, begins on February 12. --Reuters--
