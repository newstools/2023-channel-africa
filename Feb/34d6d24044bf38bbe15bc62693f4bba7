The head of police told journalists that the changes were guided by police regulations on the security of a retired president. "He is very safe and secure... Whatever has been done is in good faith," Inspector General Japheth Koome said today. Kenyatta's security of 96 elite officers has been reduced to 25 while the former First Lady has five, the Daily Nation reports. Former influential Ministers during President Kenyatta's tenure have also had their security whittled down. Ruto allies have been calling for investigations into tax waivers enjoyed by the Kenyatta family during former Kenyattaâ€™s reign. Ruto this week accused tax cheats of funding recent opposition rallies.
