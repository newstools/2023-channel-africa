Abubakar said on Twitter that his party was "securing the highest number of valid votes cast as well as the statutory 25% in at least two thirds of the States." This is despite the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) only declaring official results from one out of Nigeria's 36 states. The candidate of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) party, Bola Tinubu, won most of the votes from south-western Ekiti State, receiving 201 494 votes. Abubakar received 89 554 votes, while Peter Obi of the Labour Party got 11 397 votes. Inec Chairperson Mahmood Yakubu said the commission would announce some of the results from the other States at 10:00 GMT on Monday. INEC said on Sunday that it was working to fix glitches on its election results viewing portal. It came after Abubakar urged INEC to order its officers to upload all results to the portal to prevent alleged attempts to compromise the vote. Final presidential results are expected to be declared by March 1. The vote on Saturday was marred by pockets of violence, widespread delays, and logistical problems. The Economic Community of West African States' (Ecowas) election observer mission described the election as generally peaceful and with a massive voter turnout. --BBC--
