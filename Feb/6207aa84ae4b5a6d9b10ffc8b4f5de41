The Times of Israel quotes an Israeli Foreign Ministry Spokesperson as blaming South Africa (SA) and Algeria for the incident. The video appears to show a security guard approaching the Israeli delegation while the opening ceremony was going on. There was a discussion and Bar-Li, who is Israel's Deputy Director General for Africa, then left alongside a security guard. “Israel views seriously the incident in which the deputy for Africa, Ambassador Sharon Bar-Li, was removed from the African Union hall despite her status as an accredited observer with access badges,” Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lior Hayat is quoted by the Times of Israel as saying. “It is sad to see that the African Union has been taken hostage by a small number of extremist countries such as Algeria and SA, driven by hatred and controlled by Iran,” Hayat said. "They must substantiate their claim," a Spokesperson for South Africa President is quoted by the AFP news agency as saying. Israel's status at the AU has been the subject of debate recently. It gained observer status in 2021, but this decision was queried, with Palestinians urging a rethink, and a committee was formed last year to look at the issue. In recent years, Israel has aimed to form closer ties with African countries. Earlier this month, Chad's President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno was in Israel to open an embassy in Tel Aviv. --BBC--
