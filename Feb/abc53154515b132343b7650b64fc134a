The three-storey building, which was under construction, is in Gwarinpa, a residential suburb. Nkechi Isa, Spokesperson for the Federal Capital Territory Management Agency, said in a statement that at least 19 people had so far been rescued with one fatally injured. She said the victims, mostly construction workers, had been taken to hospitals around the city centre. A combined team of emergency and security agencies went to the scene to help with the rescue. Some construction companies with heavy duty equipment have also moved in to help in the rescue efforts. --BBC--
