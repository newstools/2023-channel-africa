Botswana's consumer inflation dropped to 9.3% year on year in January from 12.4% in December, but it is still far above the central bank's 3%-6% preferred band. "It is projected that inflation will trend downwards in Botswana and revert to within the objective range of 3%-6% in the second quarter of 2024," said Bank of Botswana Governor Moses Pelaelo, attributing the predicted fall to an expected reduction in domestic fuel prices and international commodity prices. Botswana's economy is expected to grow 4% in 2023, down from 6.7% in 2022, he told a news conference. --Reuters--
