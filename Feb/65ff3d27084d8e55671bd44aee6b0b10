Adams has already qualified for the Olympics, that will take place in Paris next year after he ran under 20 seconds during the Diamond League last year in France. He made headlines when he beat Olympic gold medallist, Canadian Andre de Grasse. Adams now believes he is on the right track to booking himself a spot on the Olympic podium. The 26-year-old started competing in the Diamond League in Europe in 2018. It is there where he beat some of the sport’s biggest names such as Fred Kerly, and has never looked back. His first international race will be in Atlanta, United States. Adams has acknowledged that it will not be an easy task to beat world-renowned 200 metres sprinters such as World champion, American Noah Lyles, Andre de Grasse, Kerly and Kenny Bednarek. “I’ve had numerous injuries since 2021, but I recovered. It was a very frustrating time for me, but I had no choice but to be strong and believe in myself. I am ready for my first race now,” says Adams. Adams recorded the second-best time when he clocked 19.82 at the Diamond League last year, making him the fastest man in Africa. --SABC--
