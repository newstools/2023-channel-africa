Their win follows hot on the heels of last year’s Grammy win by DJ Black Coffee in the Best Dance Electronic Category. The 65th annual Grammy Awards are being held in Los Angeles California and hosted by another South African Trevor Noah. This was flautist Kellerman’s 4th nomination and his second Grammy. “Thank you so much. This is such a beautiful moment, on the road to sharing South African music and culture with the world. Thank you Nomcebo, thank you Zakes for your incredible creativity. Thanks to Tulsi Pillay my manager and friend who stood with me. Thanks to JB and all the musicians who worked on the album. Thanks to you all my peers who’ve supported us I’ll never forget it,” he added.
