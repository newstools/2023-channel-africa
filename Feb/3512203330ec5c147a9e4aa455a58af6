A tiny green grasshopper-shaped parasite called "jasside" has infested cotton crops and slashed output forecasts across West Africa for the 2022/23 season. Adjoumani said that the government would allocate $57.48 million to help compensate farmers for their losses. Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, was among Africa's leading cotton exporters before civil war broke out in 2002. Its cotton sector had been recovering for the past decade after years of political turmoil caused production to plummet. The Minister added that the 2023 farmgate price for cashew nuts has been set at $0.5245 per kg, up from $0.51 in 2022. Ivory Coast cashew nut output rose 6% to 1 028 172 tons in 2022 due to good weather conditions. It is expected to reach 1 050 000 tons in 2023, Adjoumani said. Ivory Coast has in recent years become the world's top cashew producer. --Reuters--
