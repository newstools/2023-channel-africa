The trial will take place in Kl√©ssoum, in a high-security prison, a local news website reported, citing judicial sources. The suspects belong to the Front for Concord and Change in Chad (FACT), the rebel movement which launched an offensive to overthrow Chad's goverment from its rear bases in Libya in 2021. They are being charged with terrorism, enlisting child soldiers, mercenarism and undermining State security. Deby was killed on the frontline in April of 2021 while overseeing the army's operations to drive back the rebels. He had just won a new mandate in a vote criticised as fraudulent. With the help of France, Chad's new military rulers were able to stop the rebel advance. Nearly two years since Deby's death, negotiations between the rebel movement and the Chadian government have stalled. The group has boycotted peacebuilding talks, demanding the release from jail of its members.  --AfricaNews--
