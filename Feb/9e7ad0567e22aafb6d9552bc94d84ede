Tensions between the African Great Lakes region neighbours continue to raise as the DRC accuses Rwanda of invading its territory "disguised in M23 rebels." In an address to diplomats in Rwanda on Wednesday night, Kagame criticised Tshisekedi for failing to address DRC’s internal issue and putting the blame on Rwanda. Kinshasa hasn't reacted to Kagame’s remarks. "This person has dishonoured dozens of agreements he has made with people, including even last time in Bujumbura," Kagame said. "We discuss things in the open, he participated, we wrote a communiqué, telling people what we discussed and the way forward. The communiqué is read, but the next day an opposite communiqué is read in Kinshasa," he added. Last weekend’s East African heads of state meeting in Bujumbura, Burundi, directed an "immediate ceasefire," the "withdrawal of all foreign groups," and the need for "dialogue among all the parties." A day later, a Congolese government Spokesperson said they would "only abide" by the November agreements in Luanda to end the conflict. Kagame deplored that the rebels’ issue kept "coming back for nearly three decades" despite the United Nations having more than 10 000 peacekeepers deployed to address it. --BBC--
