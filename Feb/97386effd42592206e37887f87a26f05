Analysts said the President's response to the crisis did not impress them, with no clear end in sight to the hours of daily power cuts that have hurt businesses across all sectors and hammered economic growth. The government's benchmark 2030 bond was weaker in early deals, with the yield up 5.5 basis points at 9.815%.

Ramaphosa also said he would appoint a Minister of Electricity within the Presidency, and that the government would increase existing social grants to cushion the poor against rising inflation.
