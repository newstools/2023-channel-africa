Former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, a mediator for the East African Community (EAC) bloc, says more troops need to take up positions in areas where armed groups have withdrawn, according to the Luanda ceasefire agreement. Kenyatta expressed concern over the deteriorating security situation in North Kivu province where M23 rebels have clashed with security forces in recent weeks. Uganda and South Sudan are planning to send troops after contingents from Burundi and Kenya arrived in eastern DRC last year to help end decades of instability. Kenyatta welcomed recent calls for cessation of hostilities by all sides in the conflict by East African leaders. In a statement, the facilitator said he would intensify plans for the fourth round of talks in Nairobi by mobilising regional and international support for the meeting. He has urged all parties involved to accelerate implementation of resolutions of the third consultative talks in Nairobi. He has also appealed for urgent humanitarian support to more than half a million people displaced by the conflict in North Kivu province. The conflict has strained relations with DRC, which accuses neighbouring Rwanda of backing the M23 rebels. Rwanda denies the accusations. --BBC--
