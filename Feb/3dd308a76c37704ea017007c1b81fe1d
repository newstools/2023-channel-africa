"Nigeria and the UAE have enjoyed excellent and beneficial relations for many years, including at the highest political levels. We can and must continue to iron out whatever issues arise between us", Buhari tweeted. Nigeria and the UAE have been embroiled in several diplomatic disputes with the UAE imposing a visa ban on Nigerians and suspending its national carrier, Emirates Airlines, from operating in Nigeria since October 2022. Buhari assured the UAE that judicial sanctions will be imposed on Nigerians found to have committed criminal acts in the UAE.  --BBC--
