Ismael, 26, said she had hoped Dadaab would be free of the hunger and sickness she fled in Somalia, where the worst drought in decades and surging food prices have left millions of people in need of aid. Instead, the young mother found barren land, overcrowding, and scant resources at Dadaab, one of the world's largest refugee camps and home to 300 000 people. In a ward for severely malnourished children, Ismael said her baby's condition had not improved since arriving at Dadaab. Severe malnourishment had made the baby's head swell with liquid, a common effect of malnutrition in children. "There hasn't been improvement," Ismael said, cradling the infant. After five consecutive failed rainy seasons, parts of Somalia are on the verge of famine and the rest of the country is faring little better. In the past two years, the drought has displaced one million Somalis and about 100 000 have fled to Kenya, according to the United Nations (UN). At Dadaab alone, at least 6 000 Somalis fleeing hunger have arrived at the camp since the start of the year, UN data shows, but aid workers say the number not yet registered in the UN system is up to five times that number. Those who flee often find little relief in neighbouring countries which have also been hit by the Horn of Africa's worst drought in more than four decades and are groaning under the strain of an influx of new refugees. "The new arrivals bring a scarcity to the already little resources that are available for the population here," said Dr Marvin Ngao, the top medical official for the International Rescue Committee, an aid group that runs health facilities in Dadaab. --Reuters--
