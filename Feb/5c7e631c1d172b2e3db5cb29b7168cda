"The Council adopted a decree opening the land borders of C么te d'Ivoire," said Amadou Coulibaly, adding that they would be reopened "at midnight." C么te d'Ivoire had closed its land, sea, and air borders on March 22, 2020, when the whole world was barricaded against the pandemic. While the sea and air borders reopened after a few months, the land borders remained closed. C么te d'Ivoire borders Liberia, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Ghana. Millions of people from these countries living on Ivorian soil had to take backroads to their home countries. "We are now in control of the clandestine transit routes, we invite all travellers to use the official routes from now on," Coulibaly said. C么te d'Ivoire had been relatively spared by the COVID-19 pandemic, with about 800 deaths, according to official figures. Last month, the National Security Council, chaired by Head of State Alassane Ouattara, welcomed the "excellent results recorded in the fight against Covid-19 since 2020" and announced the gradual lifting of the measures provided for under the state of health emergency.  --AfricaNews--
