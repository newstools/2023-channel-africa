The bank did not give reasons for the bond switch, in which investors are free to choose whether to participate or not. The east African country has been struggling with a rising public debt pile. In December, the bank said the surging costs of servicing Uganda's public debt was putting undue pressure on public finances. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) said investors holding the bonds maturing in April, which have a coupon rate of 11%, can now apply to convert their holdings to the various longer-dated tenures with coupon rates ranging between 14% to 18.5%. The new tenure options that investors can switch to include a three-year, five-year, 10-year, 15-year and 20-year bonds, the bank said in a statement. Auctions for the bond switch will be held on February 6 and February 8, according to the central bank.  --Reuters--
