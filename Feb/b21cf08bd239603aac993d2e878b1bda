Shiimi said during a budget speech that the budget deficit in the southern African country was seen declining to 4.2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the 2023/24 financial year from about 5.2% of GDP in 2022/23. Shiimi said 2022 growth was estimated at 4% and that 2024 growth was predicted at 2.2%. Shiimi added that it was important to maintain fiscal sustainability while carrying out reforms so sectors with significant job-creation potential like agriculture and tourism could expand. --Reuters--
