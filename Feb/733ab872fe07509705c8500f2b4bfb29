Company Managing Director, Victor Mapani, says that households and companies countrywide will now enjoy 24 hours of power supply without any disruptions. He says this had been made possible by various measures, which include restoration and upgrading of power generation at stations in the country. Mapani says Zesco had revamped the Victoria Falls power station which is currently feeding about 20 Meggawatts into the national grid. “The load shedding effectively ended 12 days ago but we are now sure that the load shedding is gone. We have gone over the cliff. We have noted that the waters are picking up in Lake Kariba, and also some other mitigations that we had to put,” Mapani said.
