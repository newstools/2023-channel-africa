Ackerman says the move is going to make it more challenging and expensive for businesses to move capital in and out of South Africa.  His comments come after the FAFT announced its decision to place South Africa and Nigeria on its grey list. "Unfortunately as expected it’s been confirmed that South Africa has been greylisted despite everything the government has done to reassure them that we’re getting our ducks in a row. This is obviously a major headwind for the environment we’re in already. If you think back to the budget this week, we’re facing significant growth challenges, failing infrastructure, a lot of structural issues that are not been resolved for a couple of years, and on top of that, our energy crisis. Being greylisted will add to those challenges especially for business in terms of operating in the country, the ease of doing business."
