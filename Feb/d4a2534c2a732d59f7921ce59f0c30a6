The Chair of the AU commission Moussa Faki Mahamat made the announcement at the end of a two-day summit in Addis Ababa. He said the AU was working with all sides to decide on a date and place for the meeting. The United Nations said recently that Libya's rival administrations had agreed on a mechanism to clear foreign troops and mercenaries from the country. But they have failed to come up with a timetable for their departure. --BBC--
