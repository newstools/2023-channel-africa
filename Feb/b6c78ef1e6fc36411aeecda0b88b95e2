The show was a lengthy celebration of African music, headlined entirely by the West African country. Burna Boy, Rema and Tems took turns to give an Afrobeats-themed performance at the halftime show. Burna Boy began by giving an energetic performance of some of his hits including Anybody, Itâ€™s Plenty, Last Last and Alone. Rema followed with renditions of his songs Calm Down and Holiday. Tems, who won her first Grammy for the Best Melodic Rap Performance in collaboration with Future and Drake, performed a number of her own songs backed by dancers. --BBC--
