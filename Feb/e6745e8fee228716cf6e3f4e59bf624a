The fighters are allied to General Johnson Olony, a Military Commander who opposes the transitional government in South Sudan. He has been fighting government forces since September 2019, when he announced he would replace South Sudanese Vice-President Riek Machar as the leader of opposition forces. United Nations (UN) peacekeepers have now been deployed to the area where fighting between his forces and government troops has already killed hundreds of people and forced tens of thousands from their homes. The tensions come as people displaced around the country by inter-ethnic fighting were beginning to return to their homes. The UN says this build-up is a threat to the civilians and could affect humanitarian operations in the volatile region. South Sudan has continued to experience widespread violence and ethnic tensions, despite a 2018 peace deal signed by rivals President Salva Kiir and former rebel leader and now Vice-President Machar. --BBC--
