"This situation in South Sudan is amongst the greatest human rights and humanitarian crises that the world is facing,” Barney Afako, a member of the panel, told reporters in a briefing in the capital. “The suffering across the country remains immense.

Pope Francis made the same appeal during his historic visit to the country earlier this month, but violence continues to spread. --BBC--
