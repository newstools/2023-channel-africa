Local organisers released 2 000 tickets Friday overnight and a further 3 000 this Saturday but by early Saturday afternoon, they were again already sold out. Meanwhile, Proteas captain Sune Luus says it is mission accomplished to finally advance to the International Cricket Council Women’s World Cup final and put women’s cricket on the map in SA. She says that the fans’ response has not gone unnoticed in the Proteas camp. For Coach Hilton Moreeng who has been at the helm of the women’s team since 2012, becoming the first men’s or women’s senior team to progress to the final of a World Cup on home shores is only fitting. The final match of the 2023 ICC’s Women’s T20 World Cup at Newlands gets underway at 15H00 CAT. --SABC--
