Ukraine hopes to secure widespread international support for a ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes after the IOC opened the door for them to compete as neutrals in Paris. Athletes from Russia and neighbouring Belarus, which aided Moscow's invasion of Ukraine a year ago, have been banned from many international competitions since. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged the IOC to ban Russia from the Olympics, and Olympic bodies and lawmakers in the Nordic and Baltic regions have backed Ukraine.
In a letter to Ukraine's National Olympic Committee (NOC) president Vadym Huttsait, seen by Reuters, Bach said claims that allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes back into the Games would promote the invasion were "defamatory". The IOC has said a boycott will violate the Olympic Charter and that its inclusion of Russian and Belarusians is based on a United Nations resolution against discrimination within the Olympic movement. "The participation of neutral athletes with a Russian or Belarusian passport at the Olympic Games in Paris 2024 has not even been discussed in concrete terms yet," Bach said. "Therefore, your letter to your fellow NOCs, to the International Federations, IOC Members and to future Olympic hosts, pressuring them in an attempt to publicly influence their decision making, has been perceived by the vast majority of them as, at the very least, extremely regrettable. "It is the responsibility of every NOC to uphold the fundamental principles of the Olympic Charter." The IOC announced last month that athletes from the two countries might be allowed to earn slots for the Olympics through Asian qualifying and compete as neutrals, with no flags or anthems.  --Reuters--
