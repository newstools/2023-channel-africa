The southern African country is currently going through its rainy season and heavy downpours have left roads submerged and buildings flooded. One southern province and the capital, Lusaka, are reported to be the worst-affected. The meteorological department warns the rains are likely to become heavier across the country in the coming days. No figures of human casualties have been issued yet by the authorities but local media outlets have tweeted pictures of drowned cattle after rivers broke their banks.
