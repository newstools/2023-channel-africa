At 11h16 CAT, the Rand traded at R18.35 per Dollar, the lowest it has been since last November. The Dollar was up about 0.06% against a basket of global currencies, after a surprise rebound in US business activity. SA Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana will deliver his budget speech at 14h00 CAT. Investors will be watching closely for pointers to the government’s policy trajectory. The focus will be on the State’s approach to SA’s power crisis. Hours of daily power cuts have crippled businesses in Africa’s most industrialised economy and weakened growth prospects for this year and next. Godongwana is expected to outline a plan for the government to take on part of the debt of struggling State power utility Eskom. He will also present updated revenue, expenditure and economic growth forecasts. “The potential for a relief rally exists if the plans around Eskom are fiscally sensitive, prudent and credible,” ETM Analytics said in a research note. But the Rand is on the defensive and Godongwana faces a tough task of restoring confidence in the economy, it said. The government’s benchmark 2030 bond was weaker, with the yield up 10.5 basis points at 10.360%. --Moneyweb-- ð¢ Today is the day of the Budget Speech!
