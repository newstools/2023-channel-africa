The Islamist Ennahda party said its leader, Rached Ghannouchi, had been asked to present himself at a police station in the capital, Tunis. Police have arrested several prominent figures critical of President Kais Saied in recent weeks. They include senior Ennahda politicians, the head of an independent radio station, an influential businessman and two judges. Saied, who dissolved parliament in 2022 before rewriting the constitution, says his actions are necessary to save Tunisia from chaos. His critics have denounced the moves as an anti-democratic coup. --BBC--
