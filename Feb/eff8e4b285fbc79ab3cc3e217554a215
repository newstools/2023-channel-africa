Undercover filming by the BBC caught local bosses pressuring a female worker for sex. The two firms, Unilever and James Finlay and Co, say these managers have now been suspended. Unilever sold its tea operation in Kenya while the BBC was filming. The new owner said it had launched a full, independent investigation. One of Britain’s biggest supermarket chains, Sainsbury’s, called the allegations "horrific" and said they had no place in its supply chain. --BBC--
