Morocco, who last hosted the tournament in 1988, were due to stage it again in 2015 but withdrew because of fears over an Ebola outbreak. But having successfully hosted both the Women's Africa Cup of Nations and the Club World Cup in the past 12 months, the Atlas Lions believe they can see off neighbours and rivals Algeria in the bidding process. "Morocco is ready," top Moroccan Official Hassan Kharbouch told BBC Sport Africa. "We just organised a successful Club World Cup after our previous successes of hosting this same tournament in 2013 and 2014." Kharbouch is director of the Mohammed VI Football Complex, a project launched over a decade ago that has been praised for its role in helping the men's national team become the first from Africa to reach a World Cup semi-final at last year's tournament in Qatar. "We've also staged the Under-17 and Under-23 Nations Cups and as hosts we delivered record African attendances for the Women's Cup of Nations in Rabat and Casablanca in 2022," Kharbouch continued. "We have all the facilities and logistics to organise the African Cup of Nations, not only in Rabat and Casablanca but also in Tangier, Oujda, Fez, Marrakech and Agadir, each venue boasting of a number of training sites." --BBC--
