A planned release of water from the Massingir dam could also result in death, said provincial Secretary of State, Lourenço Líndonde. "There are times when our populations are resistant to government measures, but we, as a government, must work to prevent deaths. No government, no State can want its population to die," Líndonde said. Gaza is also likely to be affected by Cyclone Freddy, which has caused destruction in the island of Madagascar. --BBC-- Tropical Cyclone #FREDDY is now in the Mozambique Channel moving westwards away from Madagascar tracking towards Mozambique.
