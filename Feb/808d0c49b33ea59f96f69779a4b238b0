The cyclone is expected to make landfall this Monday in neighbouring Madagascar and could affect as many as two million people, according to the United Nations. Nyusi expressed optimism at his country's experience in dealing with the effects of heavy rains and cyclones. "We have to start being people who value our experience. It is recognised. “It is up to us to sell it as a national product. As we have done things, the world considers that we have done well. As a government, as opposition parties, as Mozambicans, including civilians, we have a product that we are proud of and saleable,” he said. American broadcaster Fox News predicts Tropical Cyclone Freddy could affect nations along the coast from Tanzania to South Africa. --BBC--
