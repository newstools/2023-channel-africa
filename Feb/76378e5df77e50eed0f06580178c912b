It will be her sixth time in Africa when she arrives in Namibia this Wednesday as part of a commitment by President Joe Biden to deepen United States (US) engagement with the fast-growing region. It is her first visit as first lady, though. In addition, she will be following in the footsteps of her recent predecessors Melania Trump, Michelle Obama, Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton, who all made the trip across the Atlantic Ocean in the name of trying to help foster goodwill toward the US. During five days split between Namibia, located along the Atlantic coast in southern Africa, and Kenya, in the east, Biden will focus on empowering women and young people, and highlight food insecurity in the Horn of Africa caused by a devastating drought, Russia’s war in Ukraine and other factors. As she departed Washington Tuesday, Biden declared, “We have a lot to accomplish.” Africa is the fastest-growing and youngest region in the world, according to the White House, which says one of every four people in the world will be African by 2050. The White House has withheld specific details of the first lady’s activities in each country, citing security concerns. Biden previously visited Africa in 2010, 2011, twice in 2014 and once in 2016, all during Joe Biden’s service as Vice President. Two of those trips were with him. This time, she is traveling without the President as he wraps up his own trip to Poland to mark Friday’s anniversary of Russia’s aggression toward Ukraine. Patricia Nixon was the first lady to travel to Africa on her own. She went as Richard Nixon’s “personal representative” to Liberia, Ghana and the Ivory Coast in 1972. She addressed legislative bodies and met with African leaders about US policy toward the country now known as Zimbabwe, and human rights in South Africa, according to the National First Ladies’ Library. --AP--
