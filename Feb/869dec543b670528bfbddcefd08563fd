The river could vanish due to factors including rising sea levels resulting in saltwater intrusion downstream. Global warming and misuse of the water source by humans also adds concern its future. Sudanese man Ahmed Abakr has spent decades growing vegetables and grains near The Nile in Sudan's capital, Khartoum. "I’ve been living by The Nile my entire life, my occupation is farming and it was my grandfather’s occupation too. The Nile is our source of living and we don’t have anything else to do," the 85-year-old says. Global warming and misuse by humans now jeopardise the future of the world’s second-longest river. The flow of the Nile has fallen from 3 000 cubic metres per second to 2 830 in the past five decades. This drop impacts Nile basin residents like Abakr. "Agriculture now is not like before, water levels are changing every year, which impacts my crops. It take longer, and I have to use plumbers in order to irrigate the crops. They also need gasoline and that’s an added cost to growing my crops." Water expert Ahmed Almofti predicts even more serious problems are around the corner. "With the expected loss of water from environmental impacts, another issue is the increase of population against the current Nile quota. “That means an overuse of Nile water and an increase in its misuse, which threatens the future of this river." A lack of rainfall and increased droughts expected in Africa means the river’s flow could fall by 70% by 2100, according to United Nations forecasts. It is predicted there could be a 75% loss of available water per local resident. In 2010, five upstream States signed a Cooperative Framework Agreement. The text outlines principles, rights and obligations for cooperative management and development of the Nile Basin water resources. Experts believe the river can only be saved if the countries it passes through commit to better joint management and sustainable development policies. --AfricaNews--
