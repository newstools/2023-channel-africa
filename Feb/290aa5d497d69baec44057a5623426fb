Ambassador Ofra Farhi was crossing a street in Lusaka last Friday when a car pulled up alongside her and the occupants grabbed her bag, dragging her off her feet and causing her minor injuries, Ynet reported. Some cash was also in her bag. According to the report, her bodyguards, who were with her at the time, did not manage to prevent the crime. Farhi was treated at a local clinic and continued on to her scheduled meetings with local officials. She has said in a statement that though it is the kind of incident that can happen anywhere in the country, “Zambia is very safe and peaceful” and “very friendly to Israel.” Zambian Foreign Minister Stanley Kakubo and a Presidential Adviser both called Farhi to offer their support. Israel’s Foreign Minister Eli Cohen, who also called Farhi to ask about her welfare, said it is an example of the kind of dangers that diplomatic staff face. “More than once, Israel’s Ambassadors around the world have put themselves and their families at risk in order to serve the country,” Cohen said in a statement. “They deserve full appreciation for that.” Farhi is a roving Ambassador who lives in Israel and makes diplomatic visits to the countries she serves. She is also the Ambassador to Zimbabwe and Botswana and is due back in Israel in the coming days, according to the report. -- TimesofIsrael--
