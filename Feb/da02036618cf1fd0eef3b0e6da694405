Earlier, the Head of the Military Government, Captain Ibrahim Traor√©, promised to defeat the Islamist insurgency after the loss of more than 50 soldiers in the same northern region last Friday. The latest clash came late this Monday in the town of Tin-Akoff where a Burkinabe detachment was ambushed by militants. Some civilians are also reported to have been killed. Since the Islamist insurgency began in 2015 almost two million people have been displaced by the conflict. --BBC--
