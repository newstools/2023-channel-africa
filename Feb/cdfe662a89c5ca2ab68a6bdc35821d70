Chichi Ojei from the Allied Peoples Movement said people have told her she must be “out of” her “mind” to be running and that having a female President in Nigeria is “not possible”. Ojei said that the answer to Nigeria’s problems can be solved with a female President, despite the fact women are treated as “the underdog” in the country. Ojei is not expected to garner a large amount of support in the February 25 vote. Nigerians are currently battling a struggle to get fuel and access to new naira bank notes ahead of the crucial vote. --BBC--
