This year‚Äôs theme is titled "Radio and Peace." The theme comes as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues, Ethiopia‚Äôs Tigray region is troubled, DRC‚Äôs fighting continues and Mozambique‚Äôs battling militants attacks. The public broadcaster says the day has since been celebrated to highlight the important role radio plays as a primary platform to public information. It says the SABC radio portfolio has lined up content, including panel discussions and interviews on various platforms, on radio's capabilities to advocate for peace-building in many communities. For years, radio has been known as a low-cost and popular medium, which can reach people from all walks of life and even the most marginalised. According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation, the objective of World Radio Day is to raise public awareness of the importance of radio and to encourage those in power to use radio to provide access to information. Radio remains one of the much-loved mediums in the world, due to its accessibility. --SABC-- Join us on Monday, February 13, as we celebrate the 2023 World Radio Day under the theme: Radio and Peace.
