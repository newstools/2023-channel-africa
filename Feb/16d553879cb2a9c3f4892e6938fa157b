Eskom has been implementing Stage six rolling blackouts since Sunday night and this will continue until further notice. The State power utility Spokesperson, Sikhonathi Mantshantsha, says a generating unit each at Arnot, Hendrina, Lethabo and Majuba, as well as two units at Camden Power Station, suffered breakdowns Sunday afternoon. Mantshantsha says two generating units at the Lethabo Power Station were shut down due to coal constraints as the New Vaal Mine that is supplying the station has been unable to deliver the expected amount of coal during the past week because of heavy rains. --SABC--
