GDM is based in Argentina but derives most of its sales in neighbouring Brazil, where that same technology has been in use since 2014. The expectation is that three of the 13 materials be pre-launched this year, as the firm hopes to bolster its SA business and prepare incursions throughout the region. "Our target is that by 2027 more than 50% of the area planted with soybeans in SA contains our genetics," Thiago Schwonka, the company's Africa, Asia and Europe Business Leader said Monday. GDM's strategy reflects a recent push by African governments to tackle food insecurity by attracting plant genetics firms. Schwonka said that while SA is the only African nation that recognises intellectual property of autogamous, or self-fertilising plants, other countries are keen to modernise their patent laws and join the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV). All the 13 materials GDM plans to register in SA feature Bayer's INTACTA RR2 PRO GMO seed technology, designed to help soy plants resist caterpillars and the glyphosate weed-killer. SA's approval of that technology came in 2021, GDM said. Joao Schechtel, GDM's Product Placement Supervisor, noted much of SA's soy is used as cattle feed during the dry months of winter. He said corn remains SA's main crop, but added farmers may grow soy planting in corn areas because corn production costs are rising. GDM also plans to launch non-GMO wheat seeds in SA shortly. By 2027, it wants to achieve a 20% share of the wheat seed market there, the executives said. --Reuters--
