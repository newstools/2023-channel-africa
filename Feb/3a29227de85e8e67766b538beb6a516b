South Africa, who won the toss and elected to bat, set an imposing target of 164-4, with the Brits scoring 68, and then held on in an exciting finish as England fell short with 158-8 from their 20 overs. The Brits took important catches, including a spectacular one-handed diving effort, while seamer Ayabonga Khaka claimed three wickets in the 18th over to put the brakes on Englandâ€™s chase. She finished with figures of 4-29. It is the first time that South Africa has reached the final, where they face the defending champions at Newlands.  --SABC--
