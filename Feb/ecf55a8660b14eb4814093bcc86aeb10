This Saturday, German daily paper Bild reported that a working group at DFL will recommend to the DFL supervisory board on February 9 the sale of 15% of a newly created DFL subsidiary for this purpose for further consideration, citing Bundesliga sources. Valuing the business at between $18,40 and $21,65 billion, the transaction could bring in $2.70-$3.24 billion, Bild said. The DFL release said that the four-strong group, including interim managers Axel Hellmann and Oliver Leki, had agreed on "key guidelines for the further development of German professional football and a possible strategic partnership at league level." The agreement was based on intensive discussions to bring 36 clubs in the two leagues together on the issue, it said. It stressed it was not about a sale of shares in the Bundesliga but a temporary minority interest in license revenue from the media rights. A Spokesperson for DFL, contacted this Saturday about the Bild report, said there was no new comment beyond the Friday night press release. Delays to the process had resulted in the resignation of former Chief Executive Donata Hopfen last December. The rights, according to the Bild report, would be granted for 25 to 30 years, with the 36 clubs retaining control. Several private equity funds including CVC, Bain Capital, KKR, EQT, Advent, Blackstone and Bridgepoint came forward last year to express interest in the deal, in which DFL is advised by Nomura and Deutsche Bank. --Reuters--
