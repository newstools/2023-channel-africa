The AFRIGREEEN Debt Impact Fund's first closing will finance on and off-grid solar power plants for small and medium-sized commercial and industrial consumers across the continent, the statement said. The project aims to provide direct lending and asset-based debt facilities for regional and international developers and African commercial and industrial companies to develop solar infrastructure. The groups are looking to have a portfolio of twenty to thirty investments, with aim of meeting long-term debt financing needs of between $10.5 and $15.9 million, with an average of around $5.3 million over eight to ten years, the statement said. The Fund's will measure impact targets in terms of megawatts installed, megawatt hour produced, tons of CO2 emissions and litres of fuel avoided, and number of companies directly or indirectly accessing new financing channel, it said. The impact will also be measured by the number of commercial and industrial companies able to upgrade their power generation facilities and enhance their efficiency. RGREEN INVEST and ECHOSYS INVEST said that the first closing included commitments from the European Investment Bank and the International Finance Corporation. French banks Societe Generale and BNP Paribas completed the first round of funding, the statement said. The group is aiming to raise a total of $105 million from development finance institutions and private investors. --Reuters--
