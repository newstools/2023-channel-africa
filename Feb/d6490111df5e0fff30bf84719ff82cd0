At least 14 community and commercial radio stations are now registered in the country, giving radio journalists the opportunity to preach peace in line with this yearâ€™s theme, "Radio and Peace." Radio is regarded as the important tool when conveying messages of unity and peace hence, discipline and responsibility is required on the radio personnel. In a few months, Zimbabweans will be voting for new leaders and government, hence the need to continue embracing efforts by radio journalists to unite the nation. World Radio Day is a day set aside to celebrate these journalists and is commemorated on February 13 each year.  --John Cassim/Channel Africa--
