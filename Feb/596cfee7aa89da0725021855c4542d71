SA President, Cyril Ramaphosa, will take the salute as part of a military parade. Prior to this, he is expected to lay a wreath in nearby Empangeni at a World War II monument site. Armed Forces Day was instituted in 2012 to honour the work of South African National Defence Force (SANDF) members in service of the country, and to commemorate those who have fallen in the line of duty. SANDFâ€™s Captain Prince Tshabalala says, "We are very proud, we have visited province to province, and we will continue to educate our public. â€œWeâ€™ll continue to make sure that our people understand that we are not in war with them, we are deployed to serve the national interests of the country, when there is instability in support of the South African Police Services. â€œHowever, the main role of ours is to safeguard the sovereignity of SA. We must ensure our people can sleep at night knowing our borders are safe, at sea, in the air and on land."  --SABC-- As we mark this day, we appreciate that our armed forces are continuing the pursuit of the ideal for which their departed predecessors lived.https://t.co/eTJwB2rnBU Armed Forces Day in Richards Bay, KwaZulu-Natal #ArmedForcesDay2023 pic.twitter.com/d0aolk2xUX We are inspired by their bravery as we stand in the face of grave challenges confronting our society.
