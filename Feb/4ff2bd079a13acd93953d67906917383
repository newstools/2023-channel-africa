The top-seeded Polish player crushed 14th-seeded Liudmila Samsonova of Russia in 76 minutes in third-round action. Later, Swiatek, the reigning French Open champion, received a walkover into the semi-finals when the Czech Republic's Karolina Pliskova was forced to withdraw from the tournament due to a viral illness. Pliskova completed a 7-5, 6-7 (6), 6-2 win over Ukraine's Anhelina Kalinina in the third round before exiting the event. Fifth-seeded Coco Gauff of the United States (US) didn't have to take the court to reach the quarterfinals, as ninth-seeded Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan withdrew because of a lower back ailment. Rybakina is the reigning Wimbledon champion. Second-seeded Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus, who won the Australian Open in January, rallied past 13th-seeded Jelena Ostapenko of Latvia 2-6, 6-1, 6-1. Third-seeded Jessica Pegula and Madison Keys of the US as well as the Czech pair of Karolina Muchova and Barbora Krejcikova also moved into the quarterfinals. --Reuters--
