The 28-year-old Super Eagles striker sealed his switch to the Premier League club from Belgium side KRC Genk on a three-and-a-half year deal. Speaking to Eleven Sport, Onuachu explained he was sad to leave Genk after making his name at the club, while being excited to start the next phase of his career. The forward was the club's top scorer in the 2021/2022 season with 22 goals. He is top of the current goal scorer's chart with 16 goals from 18 games. The forward said: "I am happy to of course fulfil my childhood dream to play in the Prem. "But you know it is a difficult decision, a difficult situation and it's so emotional with everything I have achieved with Genk; the players, the coaches it is very emotional situation." Onuachu added: "It is an opportunity, it is the best league in the world. It is every player's dream to play there. "I think that is most of the reason why I want to try there because it is the best league in the world to try something new. A lot of transfers have passed, I think this the best chance for me to grab the opportunity." --SABC--
