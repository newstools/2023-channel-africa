Le Graet, Head of the FFF since 2011, had taken a step back amid a legal investigation into alleged sexual and moral harassment and a damning audit commissioned by the Sports Ministry. Earlier this month, the audit concluded that the 81-year-old Le Graet no longer had "the necessary legitimacy" to administer and represent the sport in France and "highlighted the inappropriate behaviour of Le Graet towards women". Le Graet has denied any wrongdoing. --Reuters--
