Meanwhile, the IMF said that Nigeria should consider extending a deadline to swap old banknotes because of the disruption to trade and payments being caused by a shortage of new notes. Nigerians have to turn in 1000 ($2.17), 500 ($1.08), and 200 ($0.43) Naira notes by Friday, when they cease to be legal tender. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has started releasing newly designed notes, but many Nigerians say they are not yet available in banks, sparking acute cash shortages and chaotic scenes at banks. --Reuters--
