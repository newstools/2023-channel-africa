At least two people died this Monday following violent clashes between protesters and Congolese security forces. The demonstrators accuse the United Nations(UN) and the East African Regional Force of failing to support the Congolese military operations against the M23 rebel group. Fighting has intensified in the region in recent days with the group taking key towns in eastern DR Congo. Protesters have taken to the streets in several neighbourhoods of Goma, in North Kivu province, bringing the city to a standstill. This Monday, security forces fired tear gas to disperse crowds who pelted stones and threw petrol bombs at the UN headquarters in Goma. Reports said a church in one of the neighbourhoods was demolished during the clashes. The rebels have captured large swathes of territory in the volatile province in recent days and have threatened to march on to Goma, the region's commercial hub. The recent fighting has killed hundreds of people and displaced thousands more. --BBCâ€”
