Photos of the tower in rainbow colours were criticised by some Ugandans who saw it as promoting acceptance of homosexuality among children. Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda. In a statement, the Mayor of Entebbe said: "For years, the children of Uganda have only understood the rainbow is a beautiful arch of colours and biblically it reflects the beauty and majesty of God. â€œIt is unfortunate that certain movements have decided to use the rainbow to represent and reflect, certain acts that go against the norms of the people of Uganda." He said the municipality had partnered with a local organisation to renovate the park and make it safer for children, but took note of reactions to the makeover. "The concerns raised by the public were heeded to and the rainbow painting was removed from the children's park," Mayor Fabrice-Blad Rulinda said. --BBC--
