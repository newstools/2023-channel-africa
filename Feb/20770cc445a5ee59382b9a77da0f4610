"Currently, we call it West African Studios, but that’s a working title. We have been working on this for three or four years to raise a plan that puts a facility at the centre of African filmmaking. There’s a lot for African filmmaking, but the facilities are lacking," the British actor told Ghanaian media. He said that he hopes the project will attract more filmmakers to Ghana and West Africa. Elba also revealed that he plans to film a movie in Ghana in December, which will be the second time he has gone to the country to do so. However, some people have criticised the move, saying the actor was side-lining his Sierra Leonean roots. He addressed this on his Twitter, telling his Sierra Leonean fans: "I haven't forgotten about you". Idris Elba is best known for staring in several film and TV productions including Luther, Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom and The Wire, amongst others. --BBC-- African Governments move at their pace not mine but progress for ONE is progress for ALL.
