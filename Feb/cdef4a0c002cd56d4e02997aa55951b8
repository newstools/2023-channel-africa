Henok Mulubrhan, who was the 2022 African continental championship winner, waited until the last metres to launch an attack and beat his closest rivals. The prize was presented to him by Rwandan President Paul Kagame. "This is the best day of my life It was always my dream to win this race. The game was too tough in general. I will always remember this achievement," he said.. Eritrean riders won the yellow jersey for the fourth time this year after the Tour du Rwanda was upgraded to category 2.1 event. Chris Froome, the four-time Tour de France winner, also took part in the tournament but went largely unnoticed. Earlier, he had told reporters that the Tour de France in July was his main goal and that he was working hard to get in shape for it. In 2021, Spanish rider Cristian Rodriguez became the only and first European to win the Tour du Rwanda. --BBC--
