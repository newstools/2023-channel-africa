This follows five extensions of the scheme's deadline, as the West African nation fought to secure participation of 80% while holdouts persisted despite several revisions to the original December offer. In a statement, the Ministry said participation had exceeded 80% without giving further details. "The government is ... grateful for the overwhelming participation of all bondholders. â€œYour support and contributions have gotten your country much closer to securing the IMF programme," it said.

Its bilateral lenders are discussing the formation of an official creditor committee, a first step needed to engage in debt relief talks, sources told Reuters Monday. --Reuters--
