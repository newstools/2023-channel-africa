This comes as breakdowns at Eskom's power plants have led to unprecedented power cuts that are damaging the country's economy. The National Treasury decision should free up money for spending on maintenance, transmission and distribution. President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a State of disaster over the energy crisis earlier this month, a move which allows the government to take emergency measures to intervene. Eskom has been plagued by corruption and mismanagement. It has received more than $14 billion worth of bailouts since 2008. The latest move by the government comes as the outgoing Eskom Chief Executive, who was due to exit the company next month, leaves with immediate effect. The firm's board resolved Wednesday that Andre de Ruyter would not be required to serve the balance of his notice period. In an interview with a local TV station this Monday, De Ruyter had questioned the government's ability to deal with the corruption at the utility firm. --BBC--
