Getachew made the remarks during a news conference with local media after the first meeting between TPLF officials and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, the TPLF-run Tigray Television reported. "Although there were occasions when they (Eritrean troops) withdrew in an organised manner, there are instances of in and out of small units, and this should be addressed fully," said Getachew. He added that they agreed during last week's meeting with the prime minister that federal forces should be deployed in areas bordering Eritrea "to ensure security as part of the Pretoria (peace) agreement." The African Union brokered a deal between the TPLF and the Ethiopian government in November 2022 to end hostilities and to restore basic services to Tigray region. ---BBC--
