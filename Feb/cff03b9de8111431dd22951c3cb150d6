This is part of the efforts by President Salva Kiir’s administration to contain the high cost of living that has hit households and businesses. "The IMF supports the South Sudan authorities’ efforts to ensure that the existing legal framework regarding legal tender for domestic transactions is respected," IMF Resident Representative for South Sudan Guy Jenkinson told The EastAfrican. The Bank of South Sudan (BoSS) has restricted the use of the dollar in local transactions in favour of the highly volatile South Sudanese Pound (SSP). The banking regulator has also ordered government institutions to sign dollar-based global contracts under the oversight of the Ministry of Finance and Planning, effective January 27. South Sudan is pushing for the de-dollarisation (use of domestic currency as legal tender) of the economy to tame dollar speculation, improve the value of its currency, and lower the cost of living. --TheEastAfrican--
