International Mother Tongue Day is celebrated annually on February 21. The theme for this year is "Multilingual education – a necessity to transform education." International Mother Language Day recognises that languages and multilingualism can advance inclusion, and the Sustainable Development Goals’ focus on leaving no one behind. "It is a type of education that begins in the language that the learner masters most and then gradually introduce other languages. “This approach enables learners whose mother tongue is different from the language of instruction to bridge the gap between home and school, to discover the school environment in a familiar language, and thus, learn better," says United Nations (UN)  in a statement. According to the UN, 40% of the world's population lacks access to education in a language they speak or understand. "But progress is being made in multilingual education, with a growing understanding of its importance, particularly in early schooling, and more commitment to its development in public life." Multilingualism contributes to the development of inclusive societies that allow multiple cultures, worldviews, and knowledge systems to coexist and cross-fertilise. The UN says, "Multilingual education based on mother-tongue facilitates access to and inclusion in learning for population groups that speak non-dominant languages, languages of minority groups, and indigenous languages."  --WendyMothata/ChannelAfrica--
