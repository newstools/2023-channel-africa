Medics in the city of Las Anod say they are struggling to cope with the number of casualties. The city is in an area which is also claimed by the Somali region of Puntland. The authorities there have denied that troops from Puntland are fighting alongside local militias. The President of Somalia, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, has called for all sides to hold talks to end the conflict. Somaliland broke away from Somalia in 1991 but has not been internationally recognised. --BBC--
