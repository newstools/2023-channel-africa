President Mahamat Deby is on a visit to Israel and met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday in Jerusalem. Chad, which has a majority Muslim population, cut ties with Israel in 1972. Netanyahu's office said the two leaders will officiate the opening of the embassy but did not mention where it would be located. "We believe that our co-operation can help not only advance our relations and our co-operation but it is also part of Israel's coming back to Africa and Africa's coming back to Israel. We have common goals of security, prosperity, and stability," a statement from Netanyahu said. In recent years, Israel has made a big effort to improve diplomatic relations with several African countries.  --BBC--
