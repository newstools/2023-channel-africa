It is the third straight month that Kenya's inflation has fallen. It hit 9.6% in October, its highest level since May 2017. January's inflation is still above the government's preferred band of 2.5%-7.5%. On a monthly basis, inflation was 0.2%, compared with 0.5% in December, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement. On Monday, the central bank held its benchmark lending rate steady at 8.75%, saying its last rate hike in November was still working its way through the economy. --Reuters--
