Earlier in the week there were reports that he had been found, but this was later contradicted. "I still pray and believe he's alive," Atsu's partner Claire Rupio tells the BBC. “All I can say is that, for me, I know that the rescuers are trying their best, and I just feel for everybody, those who like me and my children who are in the unknown, not knowing if their family is alive or not,” Rupio said. “And I just appeal for the club and the Turkish authorities and the British government to send out the equipment to get the people out that are still trapped in the rubble… they need the equipment, they can’t get that deep without the equipment." This Wednesday, Atsu's agent confirmed that the footballer's whereabouts were unknown, a day after it was reported that had been pulled from the rubble of a building "with injuries". Since the earthquakes struck Monday morning, more than 22 000 people in southern Turkey and northern Syria are now known to have died.
