The advertising campaign season is in full throttle. The run-up to a vote is usually a chance for small businesses like Shimatex Prints to cash in on election paraphernalia ranging from hats and flip-flops to tissue boxes and cooking oil labels. But business has been slower than usual ahead of the February 25 vote as candidates have hinged more campaigning on social media.

"A few souvenirs, a few campaign materials, a few billboards. But the impact on the print industry is not as good as it was," he told Reuters. Nigerians will vote for a new leader to replace President Muhammadu Buhari amid growing insecurity and economic hardship. The three frontrunners have promised to reduce living costs, boost growth, and tackle rising levels of violence.

Not everything has moved online, however, as parties still commission political regalia for rallies and other in-person campaign events. At a printing mall in Abuja's business hub, workers pasted party logos on baseball caps and sew candidates' portraits onto T-shirts. Bold political slogans flashed from white scarves hanging in the background. "It is what we want the most craziest of orders for a printer is a good job," said print shop owner Opeyemi Osho-Arilomo. --Reuters--
