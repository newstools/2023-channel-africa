Many businesses were forced to close, and the Indian Ocean archipelago's international airport was shut. As of 10 PM local time, the Mauritius Meteorological Services said the cyclone had passed at its closest distance from the island at about 120 kilometre (km) to the north of Grand Bay. The body had issued a Class 3 cyclone warning (level 3 out of 4) for Mauritius Island. Cyclone Freddy is projected to reach Madagascar this Tuesday evening and hurtle toward Mozambique by the end of the week. The tropical cyclone is equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane and is expected to dump heavy rain and bring turbulent winds. A "significant deterioration in weather conditions" is underway, Meteo Franceâ€™s multi-hazard early warning system predicted Monday. The weather agency said the cyclone is passing around 100 km away from the islands of Mauritius and later Reunion on Monday. Mauritius has already encountered flooding and gale force winds. The regional weather observation center on the island of Reunion said that Freddy is currently rushing across the ocean with average wind speeds of 205 km per hour. It's feared that up to 2.2 million people, mostly in Madagascar, will be impacted by storm surges and flooding, according to the Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System. The Mahanoro, Mananjary, and Nosy Varita communes in western Madagascar will be first-hit on Tuesday.  --AllAfrica--
