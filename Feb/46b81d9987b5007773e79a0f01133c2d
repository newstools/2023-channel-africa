The Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM) has decried the decision by the government to allow importation of cooking fat and oil duty-free for one year, despite the existence and implementation of the EAC-CET trade regime, which puts imported finished goods such as edible oil in a tax band that attracts a 35% import duty to encourage and promote local producers. The EAC Finance Ministers adopted the 35% 4th Band of the EAC-CET on May 5, 2022, with the implementation date of July 1, 2022. The four bands of the CET are raw materials attracting a 0% duty, intermediate goods (10%), secondary intermediate goods (25%) and finished goods (35%). Among the products that fall in the fourth band are edible oils, iron and steel, dairy and meat products, cereals, cotton and textiles, and beverages and spirits. In a letter dated January 23, 2023 addressed to Cabinet Secretary for Trade Moses Kuria and signed by CEO Anthony Mwangi, the manufacturers lobby said: "KAM’s attention has been drawn by the traders’ alleged importation of finished edible oil at a preferential import duty regime for further bulk breaking into the retail market in Kenya. On behalf of our processing industry members, these allegations are of grave concern to the local manufacturing fraternity if confirmed to be true." --TheEastAfrican--
