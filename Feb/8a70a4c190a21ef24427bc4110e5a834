Seeking five more wickets to win, Ben Stokes' side needed less than a session to go 1-0 up in the two-Test series. The New Zealand batting had been decimated by Stuart Broad on the third evening, the hosts reduced to 63-5 overnight in their chase of 394. Spinner Jack Leach had Michael Bracewell tamely caught in the third over on Sunday, before James Anderson ran through the tail to claim 4-18. Scott Kuggeleijn and Tim Southee fell in successive balls and Neil Wagner slashed Anderson behind before some last-wicket resistance from Daryl Mitchell and Blair Tickner. Anderson switched ends and bowled Tickner, leaving New Zealand 126 all out and Mitchell stranded on 57 not out. It gives England their first Test win in New Zealand for 15 years and a 10th win in 11 matches since Stokes took over as captain at the beginning of last summer. In addition, it ends England's five-match losing streak in day-night Tests and is their first overseas win in a pink-ball match. The second and final Test of the series, and England's last of the winter, is in Wellington, beginning on Friday . --BBC--
