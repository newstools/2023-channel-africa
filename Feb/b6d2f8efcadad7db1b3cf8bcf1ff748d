Overnight queues have become a familiar sight at petrol stations in Nigeriaâ€™s largest city, Lagos, as many spend hours in line hoping to buy fuel. Millions in Nigeria rely on petrol, not just for transportation, but for generators to power their homes and businesses. These costs have skyrocketed over the last few months, with the price of fuel going up around 100% in the black market. The government has denied increasing the price of petrol and maintains there is enough supply to meet demand. But it blames the independent oil marketers, who are responsible for selling and distributing the product, for worsening the crisis. --BBC--
